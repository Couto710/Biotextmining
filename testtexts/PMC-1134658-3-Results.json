Cell viability was determined by propidium iodide (PI) staining after culture with or without BMP-6 for 48 hours. Interestingly, BMP-6 showed a small, but reproducible mean increase of cell death from 17 to 23% (n = 5; p \u2264 0,003) in anti-IgM stimulated CD27+ memory B cells. Furthermore, Ramos cells showed a mean increase in cell death from 20 to 50% (n = 3, p \u003C 0,001, figure 3) after BMP-6 treatment. In contrast, cell death of total CD19+ cells (n = 6; p \u2264 0,32; data not shown) or CD27-IgG- na\u00efve B cells was not significantly affected (n = 5; p \u2264 0,65, figure 2).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":102,"end":107},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":253,"end":258},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":288,"end":293},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":412,"end":416},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":546,"end":551},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":596,"end":600},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":645,"end":649},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
