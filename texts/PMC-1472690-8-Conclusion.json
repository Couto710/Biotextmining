Our results also generated new insights into a very complex interplay of transcription factor binding to various known and newly identified sites in the IL-1RA promoter (Fig. 8), which can be regulated differentially by a fungal carbohydrate. Together with the in vivo studies [22,37], our findings might support the concept of protective effects mediated by glucan phosphate in pro-inflammatory conditions, especially with a dysregulated IL-1\u03b2/IL-1RA ratio [52,53].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":171,"end":177},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":221,"end":227},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":251,"end":257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":448,"end":454},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":734,"end":739},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":740,"end":746},"obj":"Protein"}]}
