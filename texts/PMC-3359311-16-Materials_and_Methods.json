Quanti-Blue contains a substrate for alkaline phosphatase and changes in the amount of NF-\u03baB/AP-1 activity were quantified by optical density (\u03bb\u200a=\u200a655) measured using a SpectraMax 384 Plus plate reader and SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":204,"end":224},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
