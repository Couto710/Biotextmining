The lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min to remove insoluble material. After normalizing protein concentrations, lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation by adding 10 mg/ml appropriate antibody plus 30 ml of protein G-agarose (Roche), and rotated for at least 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The precipitates were washed at least five times with cold lysis buffer followed by separation by SDS-PAGE under reduced and denaturing conditions. Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in 5 % nonfat milk in 0.1 % PBS-Tween 20 (PBS-T), probed with specific antibodies as described previously6. For immunoblotting of phosphorylated proteins, gels were transferred to methanol-treated polyvinylidene chloride membranes, retreated with methanol, and dried for 30 min. Blots were blocked in 5 % bovine serum albumin in 0.1 % Tris buffered saline-Tween 20 (TBS-T), and probed with specific antibodies as described previously46. Bands were imaged by the Super Signaling system (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1167,"end":1174},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
