Cells were primed with LPS (100 ng/ml) for 4 hours where appropriate. Cell culture supernatants were assayed for IL-1\u03b2 and IL-8 production by ELISA. Insert shows IL-8 secretion in response to stimulation with IL-1\u03b2 (10 ng/ml).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":45,"end":55},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":65,"end":75},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":76,"end":90},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":287,"end":292},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":474,"end":479},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":489,"end":499},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":570,"end":575},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
