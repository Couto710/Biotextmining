After a 24-h culture in serum-free conditions and stimuli as indicated in the figures, luciferase activity was measured by the dual luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. PMA/ionomycin was used to stimulate the cells, because the transfection was only transient and the luciferase assay required a strong and fast stimulation of the cells. To evaluate the effect of overexpression of RUNX1 or RUNX3 on FOXP3 protein levels, CD4+ T cells were preactivated with 2 \u00b5g/ml phytohemagglutinin (Sigma-Aldrich) in serum-free AIM-V medium in the presence of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche) for 12 h, and then transfected with the vector pEGFPN1 containing the RUNX1 or RUNX3 fragment using the Nucleofector system (Amaxa Biosystems) and the program T-23. FOXP3 expression was evaluated by flow cytometry after 48 h of culture in AIM-V medium containing 1 nmol/liter IL-2.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":112,"end":117},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":127,"end":137},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":189,"end":194},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":196,"end":201},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":259,"end":262},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":457,"end":467},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":502,"end":512},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":681,"end":691},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":767,"end":773},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":767,"end":773},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":777,"end":791},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":777,"end":791},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":795,"end":800},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":804,"end":809},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":813,"end":818},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":835,"end":838},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":879,"end":897},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":973,"end":977},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1005,"end":1016},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1005,"end":1016},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1056,"end":1061},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1065,"end":1070},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1151,"end":1156},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1157,"end":1167},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1266},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
