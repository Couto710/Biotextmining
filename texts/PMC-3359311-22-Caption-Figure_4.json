PBMCs were stimulated with P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 for 3 hours. A representative histogram of the % caspase-1-active cells is shown in (A) with the averaged values shown in (B).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
