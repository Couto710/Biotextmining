In generating the double knockout cell lines we targeted the PKD1 loci in a PKD3\u2212/\u2212 cell line that expressed a Flag-PKD3 transgene under the control of a doxycycline-inducible promoter. Hence, in the presence of doxycycline, Flag-PKD3 expression in PKD1/3 double knockout cells is comparable to endogenous PKD3 present in wild-type DT40 cells and removal of doxycycline from the culture media for 5 days results in a completely null PKD phenotype (Fig. 1A).\nPreviously, we have demonstrated that phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) during BCR engagement is defective in PKD1/3\u2212/\u2212 B cells and can restored upon re-expression of a single PKD isoform [1]. The small heat shock protein HSP27 has recently been proposed as a PKD1 substrate [24] and we accordingly assessed whether PKD-null DT40 cells have defective phosphorylation of HSP27 on serine 82, the proposed PKD1 substrate sequence. We initially investigated the regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation in single knockout DT40 B cells lacking either PKD1 or PKD3. As shown in Fig. 1B, activation of the BCR or treatment with the DAG-mimetic PdBu increased the levels of HSP27 phosphorylation at S82 in wild-type DT40 B cells. BCR and phorbol ester signals were also able to increase HSP27 phosphorylation in PKD1 or PKD3 single knockout DT40 B cells (Fig. 1B). However, BCR- and phorbol ester-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 on S82 was abolished in B cells that lacked both PKD1 and PKD3 (Fig. 1C). Significantly, doxycycline-induced expression of the Flag-PKD3 transgene in the double knockout cells was sufficient to restore normal regulation of HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig. 1C). In contrast, expression of a kinase-deficient PKD3 mutant protein in the double knockout cells was not able to restore BCR- or phorbol ester-induced HSP27 phosphorylation (Fig. 1D). Hence, PKD3 as well as PKD1 can regulate HSP27 phosphorylation and in DT40 B cells they are functionally redundant as HSP27 kinases.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":3,"end":7},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":11,"end":16},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":17,"end":32},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":103,"end":110},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":103,"end":110},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":129,"end":133},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":138,"end":142},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":222,"end":226},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":222,"end":226},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":227,"end":237},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":227,"end":237},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":248,"end":252},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":256,"end":260},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":343,"end":347},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":358,"end":362},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":381,"end":390},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":398,"end":402},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":512,"end":516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":517,"end":527},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":531,"end":535},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":536,"end":537},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":538,"end":553},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":538,"end":553},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":588,"end":592},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":895,"end":899},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":900,"end":901},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1007,"end":1012},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1049},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1126,"end":1135},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1136,"end":1151},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1160},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1164,"end":1173},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1192},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1253},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1257,"end":1262},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1263,"end":1278},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1311,"end":1318},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1311,"end":1318},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1326,"end":1330},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1334,"end":1338},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1422,"end":1431},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1446,"end":1451},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1452,"end":1467},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T54","span":{"begin":1471,"end":1474},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1550,"end":1558},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1559,"end":1564},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1565,"end":1580},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1584,"end":1588},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1592,"end":1596},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1604,"end":1612},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1604,"end":1612},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1669,"end":1676},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1677,"end":1692},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1696,"end":1701},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T60","span":{"begin":1705,"end":1708},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1713,"end":1722},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":1713,"end":1722},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":1739,"end":1745},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1739,"end":1745},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1751,"end":1755},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1760,"end":1764},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":1803,"end":1810},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":1811,"end":1821},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1834,"end":1838},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":1882,"end":1903},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E34","span":{"begin":1911,"end":1921},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1925,"end":1930},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E35","span":{"begin":1931,"end":1946},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E36","span":{"begin":1971,"end":1981},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E37","span":{"begin":1994,"end":2003},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2004,"end":2008},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E38","span":{"begin":2069,"end":2076},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E39","span":{"begin":2099,"end":2106},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2107,"end":2112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E40","span":{"begin":2113,"end"
