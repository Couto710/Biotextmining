(B) Nuclear GATA-3 immunoreactivity in PBMCs from seven steroid-na\u00efve asthma patients 2 h following inhaled FP treatment (100 or 500 \u00b5g via spacer). The median and interquartile ranges for each treatment are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot (n\u200a=\u200a7); * p\u003C0.05 Wilcoxon's rank test compared with placebo. (C) Immunoblotting analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of GATA-3, and increased cytoplasmic GATA-3 expression after inhalation of FP. (D) Immunoblotting analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in nuclear expression of GATA-3, and increased cytoplasmic GATA-3 expression 2 h after inhalation of FP. Histone H1 and MEK-1 immunoblotting confirmed equivalent total protein loading for the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions respectively. Quantification of the densitometry data in (C) and (D) is shown as a box-and-whiskers plot of results from n\u200a=\u200a6 participants for which data were available. *p\u003C0.05 compared to control. (E) Western blot analyses of PBMCs demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in dual phosphorylation (threonine-180 and tyrosine-182) of p38 MAPK after inhalation of FP (500 \u00b5g). The results shown in (E) are representative of samples from two participants.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":31,"end":38},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":39,"end":45},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":46,"end":53},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":54,"end":66},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":164,"end":166},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":171,"end":177},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":178,"end":185},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":186,"end":198},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":186,"end":198},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":212,"end":218},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":564,"end":573},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":564,"end":573},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":574,"end":582},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":586,"end":593},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":594,"end":604},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":608,"end":614},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":620,"end":629},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":630,"end":641},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":642,"end":648},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":649,"end":659},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":751,"end":759},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":763,"end":770},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":771,"end":781},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":785,"end":791},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":807,"end":818},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":819,"end":825},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":826,"end":836},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":880,"end":885},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R15","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R18","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R20","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T25","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R3","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
