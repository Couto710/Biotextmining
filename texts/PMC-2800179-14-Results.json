Colon length dramatically decreased in all treated rats with a more pronounced effect being observed in the 40 kDa dCGN treated group (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, prolonged exposure to 40 kDa dCGN resulted in high macroscopic and histological scores of inflammation (Fig. 1B, C). Only weak myeloperoxidase activity was detected in both control and dCGN-treated groups (Fig. 1D), indicating that granulocytes did not play a major role in the inflammation at that stage. Histological examination revealed various degrees of mucosal inflammation. Rats treated with 10 kDa dCGN showed edema, epithelium atrophy and slight lymphocyte infiltration (data not shown). These symptoms were totally absent in the colon of control rats (Fig. 1E). More severe mucosal injuries including ulceration, hyperplastic epithelium, crypt distortion and a strong macrophage infiltration, were observed in the 40 kDa dCGN-treated rats (Fig. 1F). No sulphated polysaccharides were detected by toluidine blue staining of colon mucosa from rats treated with either the 10 or 40 kDa dCGN (not shown). Although we cannot exclude that dCGN mat not have retained in the section during the histology procedure, this indicates that these polymers may not have been phagocytosed.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":464,"end":479},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
