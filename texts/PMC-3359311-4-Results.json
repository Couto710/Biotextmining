CD14 positive monocytes from CF patients and healthy controls showed a significant increase in caspase-1 activation upon stimulation with LPS+ATP, PAO1, and LPS+Poly(dA:dT) (Fig. 4a) but this activation was not different between CF and control subjects (Fig. 4b).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":181,"end":185},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
