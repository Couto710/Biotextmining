Ro-31-8220, G\u00f6-6976, Rotterin, and BAPTA/AM were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Low endotoxin RPMI and X-vivo serum free medium were obtained from Lonza Walkersville Inc (Walkersville, MD). Fetal bovine serum (FBS, certified \u003C0.06 endotoxin units/ml endotoxin levels) was purchased from Atlanta Biological (Lawrenceville, GA). All other cell culture reagents were obtained through Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).
