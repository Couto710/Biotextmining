Total RNA was isolated and converted to cDNA. Real-time RT PCR was performed using primers for I\u03baB\u03b1, BCL-xl or GAPDH. Data are expressed as relative fold increase of I\u03baB\u03b1 or BCL-xl gene expression upon treatment over non-stimulated cells. Data represent the mean \u00b1 S.E.M for three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":0,"end":10},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":215,"end":220},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":353,"end":357},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":359,"end":365},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":412,"end":420},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":412,"end":420},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":424,"end":428},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":432,"end":438},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":444,"end":454},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":444,"end":454},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"T7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
