One colony was inoculated into 10 ml LB broth and incubated on a shaker (200 rpm) at 37\u00b0C overnight. The bacteria were centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 \u00d7 g, washed with 3 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 8 g NaCl, 1.16 g Na2HPO4, 0.2 g KH2PO4, 0.2 g KCl, pH7) and resuspended in 50 \u03bcl PBS. The bacteria were killed by heating to 70\u00b0C for 1 h. To ensure that the bacteria were killed; 10 \u03bcl of the heat-killed suspension was spread on a LB plate and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
