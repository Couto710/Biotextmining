Cell DNA content was then analyzed by flow cytometry using an EPICS XL2 (Beckman-Coulter). Raw data for the distribution of DNA content of 30,000 cells retrieved from the cytometer were expressed as the percentage of G0/G1 through G2/M populations. Multicycle AV software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA) was used to generate DNA content frequency histograms and facilitate data analysis.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
