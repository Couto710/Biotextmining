Results were analysed using one-way ANOVA with Newman-Keuls post test except for the data from the in vivo inhaled FP study, which was analysed by Friedman's test with subsequent Wilcoxson matched pair signed rank sum test. Data from this analysis are presented as a box-and-whiskers plot. Friedman's test was used as three matched measures were obtained using placebo, 100 \u00b5g, and 500 \u00b5g of inhaled FP, which had variable baseline levels. We did not assume a Gaussian distribution of the data due to the limited numbers of participants analysed (seven).The null hypothesis was rejected at p\u003C0.05.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
