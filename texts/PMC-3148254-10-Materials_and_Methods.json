FLAG-tagged mouse HOIP cDNA was inserted into the multiple cloning site of pMIP. A pMIP construct encoding mouse IKK\u03b3 with an amino terminal birch profilin peptide (BP)-tag was also prepared. Retroviral particles were generated by transient transfection of 293T cells with pMIP, pMIP-HOIP, or pMIP-IKK\u03b3 and the packaging vector pCL-Eco [32]. Two days after transfection, culture supernatants were harvested and filtered. A20.2J or HOIP-deficient cells were added to 24-well plates (2.5\u00d7105 cells/well) with 1 ml virus-containing supernatant and 8 \u00b5g/ml polybrene. Plates were centrifuged at 500 x g for 2 hrs at room temperature. Cells were cultured in B cell culture medium for 48 hrs, after which the transduced cells were selected in 3 \u00b5g/ml puromycin.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":102,"end":106},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":111,"end":115},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":306,"end":310},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":401,"end":405},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":572,"end":576},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":586,"end":590},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":719,"end":723},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":724,"end":733},"obj":"Negative_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
