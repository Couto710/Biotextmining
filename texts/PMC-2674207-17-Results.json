This interaction between GR and importin-\u03b1 was significant at concentrations as low as 10\u221212 M and was maximal with 10\u22128 M FP. Subsequent GR nuclear translocation was rapid and sustained at significant levels for at least 14 h (Figure 2B). Using IP-Western blotting we showed that FP at 10\u221212\u201310\u22128 M decreased the association between GATA-3 and importin-\u03b1 induced by anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation in a concentration-dependent manner (Figure 2C). In addition, using GFP-labelled GATA-3 and confocal microscopy we demonstrated that GATA-3 nuclear import following anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation for 30 min was attenuated by pretreatment with FP (10\u22128 M) (Figure 2D).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":17,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":34,"end":40},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":41,"end":44},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":121,"end":130},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":131,"end":133},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":145,"end":151},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":152,"end":156},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":152,"end":156},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":176,"end":183},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":184,"end":190},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":184,"end":190},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":236,"end":238},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":349,"end":351},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":352,"end":359},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":360,"end":373},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":511,"end":520},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":525,"end":536},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":545,"end":551},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":567,"end":574},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":623,"end":632},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":672,"end":691},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":737,"end":743},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":744,"end":751},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":752,"end":758},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":759,"end":768},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":810,"end":820},"obj":"Negative_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T21","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
