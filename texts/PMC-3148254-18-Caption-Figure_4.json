Cells were activated with CD154-expressing insect cells for the times indicated. As a negative control, cells were stimulated with insect cells lacking CD154 (5 minute time point only). Western blots of whole-cell lysates were probed with the indicated antibodies. Phospho-I\u03baB\u03b1 (pI\u03baB\u03b1) and phospho-JNK (pJNK) blots were stripped and reprobed for total I\u03baB\u03b1 and total JNK, respectively (anti-JNK antibodies recognize p46 and p54 isoforms). I\u03baB\u03b1 blots were also reprobed for actin to demonstrate equal lane loading. Molecular weights are indicated at right. Similar results were obtained in a second experiment and in two additional experiments with a second HOIP-deficient clone.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":57,"end":61},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":62,"end":71},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":79,"end":83},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":120,"end":124},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":125,"end":134},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":254,"end":258},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":259,"end":268},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":320,"end":324},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":326,"end":330},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":336,"end":340},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":369,"end":374},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":375,"end":385},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":487,"end":494},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":495,"end":500},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":608,"end":620},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":622,"end":627},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":695,"end":699},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":782,"end":786},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1004},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1005,"end":1014},"obj":"Negative_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T12","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
