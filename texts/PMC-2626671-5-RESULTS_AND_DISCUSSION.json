As expected (17, 21), naive Tbx21\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells produced IFN-\u03b3 poorly upon activation (Fig. 2 A). Notably, this deleterious effect of T-bet deficiency was only observed in differentiating CD8+ T cells until day 4 of culture but was almost completely mitigated by day 6 (Fig. 2 A). This most likely reflected compensation by Eomes, which was strongly induced between days 4 and 6 (Fig. 1). In contrast, T-bet\u2013deficient T cells cultured for 6 d showed no defect in perforin mRNA expression (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 4). We consistently observed a modest reduction in GzmB mRNA in T-bet\u2013deficient T cells (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1 and 4), which did not translate into a decrease in expression of granzyme B protein (Fig. 2 C).\nTo examine the role of Eomes, we transduced naive CD8+ T cells from WT and Tbx21\u2212/\u2212 mice with retroviruses containing internal ribosome entry site (IRES)\u2013GFP that were either empty or encoded a strongly transactivating version of Eomes (Eo-VP16) (8), and expanded them for 6 d under our culture conditions. Eo-VP16, but not the empty GFP retrovirus, increased perforin expression in both WT and T-bet\u2013deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6). As expected, Eo-VP16 also rescued the early defect in IFN-\u03b3 production observed in T-bet\u2013deficient CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2 D). However, Eo-VP16 did not induce GzmB mRNA expression in either WT or T-bet\u2013deficient cells; thus, the partial T-bet dependence of GzmB mRNA expression cannot be compensated for by Eo-VP16.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":8},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":13,"end":23},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":24,"end":34},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":24,"end":34},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":55,"end":64},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":55,"end":64},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":68,"end":73},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":153,"end":163},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":153,"end":163},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":153,"end":163},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":167,"end":172},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":174,"end":182},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":188,"end":198},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":202,"end":205},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":227,"end":232},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":234,"end":239},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":241,"end":250},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":285,"end":290},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":294,"end":297},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":307,"end":315},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":316,"end":321},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":393,"end":398},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":399,"end":409},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":447,"end":450},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":583,"end":588},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":609,"end":616},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":661,"end":666},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":667,"end":676},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":712,"end":718},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":722,"end":730},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":731,"end":746},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":816,"end":825},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":829,"end":833},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":842,"end":847},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":848,"end":857},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":932,"end":940},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":944,"end":954},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":958,"end":968},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1017},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1039,"end":1042},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1064,"end":1069},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1143,"end":1146},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1219,"end":1224},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1226,"end":1233},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1296,"end":1303},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1323,"end":1326},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1348},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1349,"end":1357},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1358,"end":1368},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1384,"end":1389},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1390,"end":1399},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1400,"end":1403},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1460,"end":1467},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1473,"end":1480},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1491,"end":1497},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1501,"end":1506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1507,"end":1517},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1530,"end":1535},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1536,"end":1545},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1546,"end":1549},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1580,"end":1587},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1596,"end":1602},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1603,"end":1607},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1608,"end":1623},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1640,"end":1645},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1646,"end":1655},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1681,"end":1686},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":1687,"end":1697},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1701,"end":1705},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":1706,"end":1721},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1751,"end":1758},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R16","pred":"th
