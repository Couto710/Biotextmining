Motif prediction programming, using COILS [11] and MotifScan [12], suggests that SHARPIN contains a coiled-coil (CC) domain, a ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain, and a zinc-finger Ran-binding protein 2 (ZFRBP) domain. These functional motifs constitute similar domain profiles that are present in the SHARPIN protein of all three origins (Fig. 1A), suggesting that SHARPIN exerts highly conserved functions across species. Spontaneous mutations in the mouse Sharpin gene results in a complex inflammatory phenotype characterized by severe dermatitis (Fig. 1B), systemic inflammation and an enlarged spleen (Fig. 1C) caused by extramedullary hematopoiesis [3]. The endogenous expression of Sharpin mRNA in BMDC was determined by quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) following culture in medium only or after stimulation with LPS. Sharpin mRNA was present in BMDC generated from WT mice (Fig. 1D) and its level was modestly decreased by LPS stimulation. There was a significant reduction of Sharpin mRNA (6\u20137-fold) in BMDC generated from cpdm mice. Transfection of Flag-tagged Sharpin in fibroblasts (NIH3T3) and macrophages (RAW264.7) indicated cytoplasmic localization of the SHARPIN protein (Fig. 1E).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":20,"end":27},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":41,"end":48},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":200,"end":207},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":414,"end":421},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":478,"end":485},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":548,"end":557},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":571,"end":578},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":788,"end":798},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":802,"end":809},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":942,"end":949},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":959,"end":966},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1044},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1089,"end":1098},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1102,"end":1109},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1195},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1257,"end":1268},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1281},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1296},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
