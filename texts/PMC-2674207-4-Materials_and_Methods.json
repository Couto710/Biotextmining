PBMCs were isolated by density centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque (density, 1.077 g/ml; Amersham Biosciences, Amersham, UK) as previously described [34]. Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 (1 \u00b5g/ml each) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to stimulate Th2 cytokine release in the presence or absence of FP (10\u221212 to 10\u22128M). Cytospins were prepared and GATA-3 localization determined by confocal microscopy as previously described [12].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":521,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":528,"end":540},"obj":"Localization"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
