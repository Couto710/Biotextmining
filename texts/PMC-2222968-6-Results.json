Besides GATA3\u2032s well-known positive effect on gene regulation, GATA3\u2032s repressive capabilities were previously shown to restrict Th1 commitment by inhibiting STAT4 expression [2,21], and therefore GATA3 prevents differentiation into Th1 cells. To investigate whether GATA3 can directly inhibit FOXP3 induction, we transduced GATA3 or a truncated GATA3 lacking the DNA-binding domain in human primary CD4+CD45RA+ T cells using a TAT-fused, recombinantly expressed GATA3. After transduction, the cells were activated with soluble anti-CD3/CD28 in the presence or absence of TGF-\u03b2. TAT-GATA3 was successfully transduced in a homogeneous and dose-dependent manner into human CD4+ T cells (Figure 7A, upper panel). TAT-GATA3 reduced FOXP3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, whereas a DNA-binding domain truncated version (TAT-\u0394DBD-GATA3) did not affect FOXP3 expression as compared with expression in untransduced cells (Figure 7A). In addition, we analyzed the inhibitory effect of GATA3 on FOXP3 in transgenic DO11.10 mice, constitutively overexpressing GATA3 under the control of the CD2 locus control region (DO11.10xCD2-GATA3). The thymic selection into the CD4 lineage is largely intact in DO11.10xCD2-GATA3 (RW Hendriks, unpublished data). These mice develop lymphomas at an older age, but signs of autoimmune disease were not described [22]. To investigate the effect of GATA3 on iTreg, CD4+CD62L+CD25\u2013 cells were isolated, activated with OVA in the presence or absence of TGF-\u03b2, and Foxp3 expression was analyzed after 4 d. The naive CD4+CD25\u2013 cells were Foxp3\u2013 (unpublished data). As described for the human cells, TGF-\u03b2 dramatically up-regulated Foxp3 in the DO11.10 littermate control mice. In contrast, cells from the CD2-GATA3xDO11.10 mice showed dramatically reduced Foxp3 expression when activated with TGF-\u03b2 and OVA (Figure 7B). All mice produced similar amounts of TGF-\u03b2; in addition, Smad7 was equally expressed [23] in T cells of both mice strains (Figure 7C), indicating intact TGF-\u03b2 signaling.\nTaken together, these results demonstrated a repressive role of IL-4-induced GATA3 transcription factor in the generation of iTreg cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":11,"end":29},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":33,"end":38},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":39,"end":49},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":50,"end":55},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":56,"end":66},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":67,"end":76},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":82,"end":87},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":88,"end":98},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":102,"end":106},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":147,"end":151},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":156,"end":161},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":165,"end":175},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":176,"end":181},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":191,"end":196},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":246,"end":251},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":330,"end":340},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":341,"end":346},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":347,"end":357},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":380,"end":385},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":450,"end":455},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":469,"end":476},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":477,"end":482},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":483,"end":492},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":508,"end":513},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":529,"end":534},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":535,"end":542},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":547,"end":565},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":583,"end":586},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":587,"end":593},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":611,"end":651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":716,"end":719},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":720,"end":724},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":755,"end":760},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":762,"end":771},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":854,"end":857},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":893,"end":902},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":903,"end":910},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":911,"end":916},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":917,"end":927},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":966,"end":984},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":985,"end":994},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1018},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1028,"end":1034},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1040},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1051},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1144,"end":1161},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1165,"end":1170},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1174,"end":1179},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1223,"end":1237},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1238,"end":1243},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1269,"end":1272},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1303,"end":1306},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1307,"end":1312},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1345,"end":1348},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1386,"end":1389},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1390,"end":1395},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1551,"end":1557},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1561,"end":1566},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1577,"end":1580},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1581,"end":1586},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1587,"end":1591},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1663,"end":1668},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1674,"end":1679},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1680,"end":1690},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1725,"end":1728},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1729,"end":1733},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1746,"end":1751},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1807,"end":1812},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1826,"end":1838},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1839,"end":1844},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":1913,"end":1916},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1917,"end":1922},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1956,"end":1963},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1964,"end":1969},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1970,"end":1980},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1986,"end":1995},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":2001,"
