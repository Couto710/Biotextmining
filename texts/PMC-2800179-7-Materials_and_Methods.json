After two washes in PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, cells were incubated in PBS containing 0.1% gelatin and 8% AB human serum to prevent binding to Fc receptors. Then, 5\u00d7105 cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Two other washes in PBS preceded incubation with FITC-conjugated goat antibody anti-mouse IgG diluted 1/1000 at 4\u00b0C for 30 min (Tebu). After two additional washes, analysis of stained cells was performed on an EPICS XL2 (Beckman-Coulter). The cell population was gated according to its forward and wide-angle light scattering. Data were expressed as mean relative fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 3000 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
