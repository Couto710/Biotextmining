Cytokine/chemokine levels were determined using ELISA following incubation of Jurkat T-cells with NAI (1 h) and stimulation (24 h). (A) CXCL8 expression was partially inhibited following PMA stimulation (grey bars), whereas the levels were not altered following stimulation with HK E. coli (black bars), this indicates an induction mainly regulated by AP-1. (B) TNF expression was not affected by NAI. (C) IL-6 release was completely inhibited by NAI following PMA exposure, indicating regulation through NF-\u03baB since IL-6 expression was significantly increased in response to HK E. coli than PMA. Statistical significance from the positive control (PMA/HK E. coli) was determined using Student's t-test. (n = 3).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":181,"end":186},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":187,"end":197},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":212,"end":221},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":289,"end":296},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":367,"end":376},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":384,"end":393},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":451,"end":455},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":456,"end":463},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":479,"end":488},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":531,"end":541},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":562,"end":566},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":567,"end":577},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":596,"end":605},"obj":"Positive_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
