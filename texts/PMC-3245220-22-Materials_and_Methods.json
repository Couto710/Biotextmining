The cells were restimulated with 100 ng/ml M-CSF and total mRNA was extracted from cells with Trizol (Invitrogen) and 1\u20132 \u00b5g of total RNA was used to synthesized cDNA using SuperScript III (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR was performed using SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied BioSystems, Carlsbad, CA). The reactions were performed using an ABI PRIZM 7700 machine with software Sequence Detector version 1.7 (Applied Biosystems). The target gene values were normalized to the values of GAPDH as a housekeeping gene and expressed as relative fold increase 2(\u2212\u0394\u0394Ct) over the non-stimulated samples (NS).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":223,"end":228},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
