At \u223c42 h after the initial TCR activation of 106 CD8+ T cells per well in 12-well plates, the culture media was removed and replaced with complete media supplemented with 8 \u03bcg/ml polybrene containing fresh plus concentrated virus. The plates were centrifuged at 700 g for 1 h at RT before returning to 37\u00b0C for an additional 5 h. Retroviral constructs for Eomes-VP16 and the MIG control empty vector were a gift from S.L. Reiner (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (8).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":271,"end":274},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":578,"end":588},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
