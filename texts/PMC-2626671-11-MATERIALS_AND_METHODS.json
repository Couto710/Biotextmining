After the coincubation period, cells were stained with Annexin V\u2013FITC and anti-CD8\u2013allophycocyanin. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc.); EL4 target cells (CD8-negative events) were gated, and the percentage of Annexin V+ target cells was determined.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":164,"end":167},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":322,"end":331},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":346,"end":349},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":453,"end":456},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":508,"end":517},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
