(Cell Signaling Technology) and incubated for 10 minutes on ice then centrifuged to remove the insoluble fraction. The protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and subjected to Western blotting. The immunoblotted proteins were detected by ECL reagent (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
