The cells were pulsed with 3.7 \u00d7 104Bq [3H]thymidine (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK) for the last 16 h of a 72-h incubation. The cells were harvested using an automated cell harvester (Packard Instrument Company, Meriden, CT, USA) and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined in a scintillation counter (TopCount, Packard Instrument Company Inc., Meriden, CT).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":52,"end":56},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
