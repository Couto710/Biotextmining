THP-1 human monocytic cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mM L -glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin and 50 mg/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from heparinized blood by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient. Monocytes were then isolated by adherence to culture flasks as described [28]. For cell aggregation, monocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of C10 or C40 for 72 h. Cell colonies were monitored under an inverted phase contrast microscope coupled through a video camera to a computer. In some wells, neutralizing monoclonal antibody to ICAM-1 (2.5 \u00b5g/ml) (Tebu, Le Perray en Yvelines, France) was added.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
