HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, p3xFLAG-Tat C(22,25,27), p3xFLAG-Tat R(49\u201357) or empty vector (10\u2009\u00b5g); for p65 RNA interference, cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g) and siRNA p65 or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol). Twenty-four-hour post-transfection, total RNA was extracted and analysed by real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of MIP-1\u03b1 (A), CSF3 (B), LTA (C), NFKBIA (D), TLR2 (E), GAPDH (F), ACTB (G) genes. (H) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat, or empty vector (10\u2009\u00b5g) and 48\u2009h later ChIP was performed with anti-p65 antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. (I) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with empty vector, or p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g) in presence or absence of siRNA p65, or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol); 48\u2009h later, ChIP was performed with anti-FLAG antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. (J) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with empty vector, p3xFLAG-Tat (10\u2009\u00b5g), or empty vector plus siRNA I\u03baB-\u03b1 or siRNA control (200\u2009pmol); 48\u2009h later, ChIP was performed with anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibody. Real-time PCR was performed with primers specific for the indicated promoters. Values (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093) are shown. The asterisks indicate statistically significant differences compared to the control (empty vector) according to the Student's t-test (P\u2009\u003C\u20090.05).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":72,"end":81},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":106,"end":115},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":106,"end":115},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":120,"end":123},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":124,"end":135},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":141,"end":146},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":147,"end":159},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":212,"end":215},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":225,"end":240},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":250,"end":262},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":292,"end":295},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":300,"end":312},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":360,"end":363},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":376,"end":385},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":521,"end":531},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":521,"end":531},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":521,"end":531},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":521,"end":531},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":521,"end":531},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":521,"end":531},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":521,"end":531},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":535,"end":541},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":547,"end":551},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":557,"end":560},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":566,"end":572},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":578,"end":582},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":588,"end":593},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":599,"end":603},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":670,"end":673},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":908,"end":911},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":946,"end":955},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1193},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1224,"end":1235},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E7"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E8"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E9"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E10"},{"id":"M6","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E11"},{"id":"M7","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E12"},{"id":"M8","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E13"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
