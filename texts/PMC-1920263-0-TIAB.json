To gain new insights into the transcriptional regulation of this restriction factor, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of A3G. Transcriptional start sites were identified by 5\u2032-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that a 1025\u2009bp A3G promoter sequence (from \u2212959 to +66 relative to the major transcriptional start site) displayed constitutive promoter activity. In T cells, the A3G promoter was not inducible by mitogenic stimulation, interferon treatment or expression of HIV-1 proteins. Using a series of 5\u2032 deletion promoter constructs in luciferase reporter assays, we identified a 180\u2009bp region that was sufficient for full promoter activity. Transcriptional activity of this A3G core promoter was dependent on a GC-box (located at position \u221287/\u221278 relative to the major transcriptional start site) and was abolished after mutation of this DNA element. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that the identified GC-box represented a binding site for the ubiquitous transcription factors specificity protein (Sp) 1 and Sp3.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":8,"end":11},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":12,"end":20},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":12,"end":20},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":27,"end":40},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":54,"end":62},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":68,"end":76},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":78,"end":81},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":160,"end":169},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":318,"end":328},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":408,"end":411},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":506,"end":516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":709,"end":712},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":713,"end":721},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":730,"end":739},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":873,"end":883},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1301,"end":1307},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1322,"end":1329},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1322,"end":1329},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1376,"end":1402},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1407,"end":1410},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"partOf","subj":"T17","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"partOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R3","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T4"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R5","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
