In MDMs pretreated with PKC inhibitors (Ro-31-8220, G\u00f6-6976, or BAPTA/AM) and stimulated with M-CSF, cleaved caspase-3 was elevated to levels of cells treated with vehicle alone (Figure 3A). In contrast, cells incubated with M-CSF and vehicle had less cleaved caspase-3 than cells incubated with vehicle alone or M-CSF with PKC inhibitors. These data supported the hypothesis that M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activity was regulated by conventional PKCs, not novel PKCs.\nTo confirm that PKC inhibition decreased cell survival, cells were treated with M-CSF in the absence or presence of PKC inhibitors and then also examined for apoptosis by Annexin V/PI staining. PKC inhibitors in the presence of M-CSF reduced the number of Annexin V/PI negative MDMs compared to cells treated with M-CSF alone (Figure 3B). These observations further suggested that MDM survival is promoted by M-CSF and critically involves conventional PKCs and NF-\u03baB activity.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":160,"end":165},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":241,"end":251},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":255,"end":262},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":263,"end":272},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":317,"end":325},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":329,"end":336},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":340,"end":345},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":460,"end":465},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":467,"end":474},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":475,"end":484},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":489,"end":497},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":591,"end":596},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":613,"end":617},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":618,"end":625},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":626,"end":635},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":679,"end":684},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":747,"end":752},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":908,"end":913},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":999,"end":1008},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1056,"end":1061},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1062,"end":1069},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1093},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1097,"end":1105},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1147},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1242},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R13","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"T19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T18"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"T17"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
