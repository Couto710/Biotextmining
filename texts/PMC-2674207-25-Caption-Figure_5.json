(B) Western blot analysis showing that FP (10\u22128 M) does not affect whole-cell GATA-3 degradation over 17 h. (C) GFP-tagged GATA-3 is overexpressed and cells stimulated (b\u2013j) or not (a) with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of treating cells with FP (10\u22128 M, f\u2013j) after 30 min stimulation with anti-CD3/CD28 is also shown. (D) FP (10\u22128 M) does not prevent anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated p65 nuclear translocation at 60 min after stimulation. **p\u003C0.01 compared to unstimulated cells. All results are representative of at least four independent experiments and are shown as mean\u00b1SEM. Results were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":32,"end":38},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":39,"end":45},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":54,"end":60},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":159,"end":165},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":196,"end":203},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":218,"end":228},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":229,"end":235},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":236,"end":243},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":244,"end":256},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":435,"end":441},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":453,"end":459},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":460,"end":471},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":498,"end":504},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":715,"end":722},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":737,"end":747},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":748,"end":751},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":752,"end":759},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":760,"end":773},"obj":"Localization"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R12","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E8"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E7"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E9"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
