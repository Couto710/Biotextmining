Supernatants were collected for ELISA of IL12P70, IL6, and GMCSF, and for quantification of nitric oxide (NO). (E\u2013F) Gradient numbers (1\u00d7104, 2\u00d7104, and 4\u00d7104 cells in 0.1 mL complete medium) of BMDC were used for100 ng/mL LPS stimulation. After 24 hours, the amounts of IL12P70 and IL6 from the supernatant were measured. (G) The cpdm mice rescued by Sharpin-containing BAC had complete remission of the inflammatory phenotype [2]. BMDC developed from cpdm and rescued cpdm mice were plated (1\u00d7106 cells in 0.3 mL) and stimulated with 100 ng/mL LPS. After 24 hours, supernatants were collected for analysis of IL12P70 production. Data are representative of three independent experiments. * P\u003C0.01; ** P\u003C0.005.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":289,"end":292},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":298,"end":303},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":522,"end":525},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":591,"end":598},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
