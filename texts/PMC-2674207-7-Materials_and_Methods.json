Promoter sequences were detected with PCR primers for the IL-5 promoter (\u2212445 to +4): forward 5\u2032-TTAATCTAGCCACAGTCATAG-3\u2032 and reverse: 5\u2032-TCATGGCTCTGAAACGTTCTG-3\u2032. PCR was performed using a Hybaid Omnigene thermal cycler (Hybaid, Ashford, UK) with cycling parameters of 72\u00b0C for 10 min, 35 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 45 s, 52\u00b0C for 45 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":337,"end":341},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
