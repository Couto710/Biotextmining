T-cells produce a broad range of inflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-6, TNF and CXCL8, all of which are important in cell proliferation, differentiation, communication and initiation of inflammatory responses [2]. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8, are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis [3-5], pulmonary fibrosis [6,7] and AIDS [8,9]. Induction of CXCL8 has been suggested to be mediated through NF-\u03baB in cooperation with AP-1 [10,11], however the precise mechanism is not fully elucidated, and treatment strategies aimed at inhibiting CXCL8 have failed [12]. Persistent production of IL-6 and CXCL8 leads to chronic inflammation and enhanced survival of lymphocytes increasing serum cytokine/chemokine levels. This forms the basis of several autoimmune disorders including plasmacytosis and hyperplasia [13]. To develop viable CXCL8 based treatment strategies, it is necessary to identify the signalling pathways regulating CXCL8 and determine how this is coupled to NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and IL-6.\nThe signalling pathways leading to NF-\u03baB and AP-1 activation are overlapping, where both are involved in the induction and regulation of cytokines/chemokines. NF-\u03baB is activated in response to stress, such as oxidative stress, bacterial toxins, viruses and UV light [14], and is essential for differentiation, proliferation and survival of many cell types including T-lymphocytes [15]. AP-1 activation requires Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2) and Jun (c-Jun, v-Jun, JunB, JunD) through the formation of homo- and hetero-dimers [16,17], and regulates transcription of a broad range of genes involved in immune responses [18-21]. Both AP-1 and NF-\u03baB binding sites have been identified in the promoter region of IL-6 and CXCL8 [12,22], however, the mechanism by which these interleukins are regulated in T-cells is still not clear. CXCL8 is a C-X-C chemokine with properties enabling it to recruit T-cells and basophils and to activate neutrophils and monocytes [23]. IL-6 is a cytokine that possesses both pro- and anti-inflammatory characteristics and that plays a key role in haematopoiesis and acute-phase responses [24,25].\nThe present study suggests that the regulation of CXCL8 and IL-6 is uncoupled. Using Jurkat T-cells exposed to PMA and heat killed (HK) Escherichia coli MG1655 in combination with inhibitors of NF-\u03baB, JNK and PKC, we demonstrated that NF-\u03baB regulates IL-6 expression while the regulation of CXCL8 more closely correlated to AP-1 activity. These results indicate that inhibition of NF-\u03baB is not an effective strategy in countering the high CXCL8 activities in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, AIDS and pulmonary fibrosis.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":123,"end":130},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":123,"end":130},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":123,"end":130},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":182,"end":186},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":188,"end":192},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":202,"end":207},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":411,"end":415},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":420,"end":425},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":544,"end":553},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":557,"end":562},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":588,"end":596},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":734,"end":744},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":745,"end":750},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":780,"end":790},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":794,"end":798},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":803,"end":808},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1037,"end":1042},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1123,"end":1133},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1134,"end":1139},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1193,"end":1197},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1615,"end":1620},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1622,"end":1626},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1628,"end":1633},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1635,"end":1640},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1651,"end":1656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1658,"end":1663},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1665,"end":1669},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1671,"end":1675},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1689,"end":1725},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1908,"end":1912},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1917,"end":1922},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1987,"end":1996},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1987,"end":1996},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2028,"end":2033},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2164,"end":2168},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":2361,"end":2371},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":2361,"end":2371},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2375,"end":2380},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2385,"end":2389},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":2566,"end":2575},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2576,"end":2580},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":2581,"end":2591},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":2602,"end":2612},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2616,"end":2621},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2649,"end":2653},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":2744,"end":2754},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2764,"end":2769},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R29","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R30","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R31","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R32","pred":"themeOf","s
