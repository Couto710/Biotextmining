Bacterially purified glutathione S-transferase (GST), GST-I\u03baB\u03b1 (1-54), wild type, mutant GST-RPS3, or RPS3 proteins were used as substrates. The in vitro kinase assay was performed as previously described29. Briefly, enzyme (100 ng) and substrate (2 \u03bcg) were co-incubated in IKK reaction buffer (25 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 8.0], 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM ATP) or NleH1 reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM ATP) with 0.5 \u03bcCi 32P-\u03b3-ATP (GE Healthcare) added at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. The reactions were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":48,"end":52},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":57,"end":61},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":222,"end":230},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":235,"end":239},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
