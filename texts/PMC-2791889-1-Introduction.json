IL-10 limits the immune and inflammatory responses to pathogens and gut flora and prevents damage to the host (Moore et\u00a0al., 2001; O'Garra and Vieira, 2004), but when dysregulated may result in chronic infection (Brooks et\u00a0al., 2006; Ejrnaes et\u00a0al., 2006; Moore et\u00a0al., 2001). IL-10 is expressed by T helper 2 (Th2) cells, B cells, DCs, and macrophages (Moore et\u00a0al., 2001), and also by Th1 cells (Anderson et\u00a0al., 2007; Assenmacher et\u00a0al., 1994; Del Prete et\u00a0al., 1993; Gerosa et\u00a0al., 1996; Jankovic et\u00a0al., 2007; Pohl-Koppe et\u00a0al., 1998) and (reviewed in O'Garra and Vieira, 2007; Trinchieri, 2007), certain regulatory (Treg) T\u00a0cells (Moore et\u00a0al., 2001; O'Garra and Vieira, 2004; Roncarolo et\u00a0al., 2006), and Th17 cells (Awasthi et\u00a0al., 2007; Fitzgerald et\u00a0al., 2007; McGeachy et\u00a0al., 2007; Stumhofer et\u00a0al., 2007).\nIn vitro human CD4+ and CD8+ T\u00a0cell clones, or mouse CD4+ T\u00a0cells that produce both interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and IL-10, can be differentiated by T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR)-stimulation in the presence of IL-12 (Chang et\u00a0al., 2007; Gerosa et\u00a0al., 1996; Jeannin et\u00a0al., 1996; Meyaard et\u00a0al., 1996; Windhagen et\u00a0al., 1996). Furthermore, Th1 cell clones coproducing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 have been isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) patients (Gerosa et\u00a0al., 1999). IL-10 production by Th1 cells was also reported in animals infected with Toxoplasma gondii (Jankovic et\u00a0al., 2002; Shaw et\u00a0al., 2006) or with Leishmania major (Anderson et\u00a0al., 2007) and shown to be required for regulation of the immune response in these infections (Anderson et\u00a0al., 2007; Jankovic et\u00a0al., 2007). The relative amounts of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 produced by Th1 cells may influence the balance between clearance and persistent infection with certain pathogens (Moore et\u00a0al., 2001; Trinchieri, 2007), thus determining whether chronic infection or immunopathology ensues.\nTh1, Th2, and Th17 cell responses differentiate along distinct signaling pathways (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Ivanov et\u00a0al., 2007; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007). Th1 cell development requires signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 activation, induced by type I IFN or IFN-\u03b3, the transcription factor T-box 21 (T-bet), and IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, which can couple with IL-18-induced IRAK and NF-\u03baB transcription factors to drive the high amounts of IFN-\u03b3 required to eradicate intracellular pathogens (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000). Th2 cell development, with expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, requires IL-4, STAT6, and the transcription factor GATA binding protein (GATA)-3 (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000). The development of Th17 cells requires IL-6, TGF-\u03b2, and the STAT3-dependent expression of the transcription factor ROR\u03b3t (Ivanov et\u00a0al., 2007; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007).\nTh1 and Th2 cell responses can also be induced by varying the dose of antigen presented to the naive T\u00a0cell by the antigen-presenting cell (APC). Whereas high doses of antigen, with sustained TCR signaling and extracellular-signal regulated (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation, result in Th1 cells producing IFN-\u03b3 via an IL-12-independent mechanism, low doses of antigen, with transient ERK1 and ERK2 activation, favor Th2 responses and IL-4 secretion (Constant et\u00a0al., 1995; Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995; Jorritsma et\u00a0al., 2003; Yamane et\u00a0al., 2005).\nBecause Th1 and Th2 cells cross regulate each other's development and function and can suppress Th17 cell responses, and all differentiate along distinct signaling pathways (Glimcher and Murphy, 2000; Stockinger and Veldhoen, 2007), IL-10 produced by all these Th cells may thus act as a feedback regulator to control the pathology associated with an overexuberant, albeit efficacious, inflammatory response. Whether IL-10 production by these different Th cell subsets is induced by independent and/or common mechanisms is unknown.\nHere, we showed that in\u00a0vitro differentiation of IL-10-producing Th1 cells from naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells required IL-12-induced STAT4 signaling, strong TCR activation (high antigen dose), and sustained ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, we showed that activation of ERK1 and ERK2 is a requirement for production of IL-10 by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cell subsets. This common but highly regulated pathway for IL-10 induction and maintenance ensures its function as a feedback loop to control damage to the host and also allows a protective response to ensue as opposed to chronic infection.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":3,"end":14},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":16,"end":21},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":157,"end":162},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":434,"end":439},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":443,"end":452},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":991,"end":994},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1000,"end":1003},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1029,"end":1032},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1054},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1054},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1060,"end":1072},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1074,"end":1079},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1085,"end":1090},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1170,"end":1175},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1327},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1327},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1328,"end":1333},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1338,"end":1343},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1467,"end":1472},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1473,"end":1483},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1805,"end":1810},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1815,"end":1820},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1821,"end":1829},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1821,"end":1829},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":2238,"end":2295},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":2295,"end":2305},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":2307,"end":2314},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":2307,"end":2314},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":2318,"end":2328},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":2332,"end":2337},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":2364,"end":2372},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2374,"end":2379},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2386,"end":2391},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2400,"end":2405},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2439,"end":2444},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":2445,"end":2452},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2453,"end":2457},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":2493,"end":2498},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":2508,"end":2515},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2519,"end":2524},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":2627,"end":2637},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":2627,"end":2637},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":2627,"end":2637},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2641,"end":2645},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2647,"end":2651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2657,"end":2662},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":2664,"end":2672},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2673,"end":2677},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2679,"end":2684},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2715,"end":2744},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2813,"end":2817},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2819,"end":2824},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2834,"end":2839},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":2840,"end":2849},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":2850,"end":2860},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2889,"end":2894},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":3253,"end":3259},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":3273,"end":3282},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":3283,"end":3288},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":3296,"end":3301},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":3302,"end":3313},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":3362,"end":3366},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":3371,"end":3375},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":3376,"end":3386},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":3376,"end":3386},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E34","span":{"begin":3388,"end":3393},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E36","span":{"begin":3388,"end
