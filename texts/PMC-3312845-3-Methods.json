The dosage of sTNFp55R was determined as the highest dose that induced SE of comparable severity in 100% of animals with 5% mortality in the preliminary study. Animals were anesthetized (Zolretil, 50 mg/kg, i.m.; Virbac Laboratories, France) and placed in a stereotaxic frames. For the osmotic pump implantation, holes were drilled through the skull to introduce a brain infusion kit 1 (Alzet, Cupertino, CA) into the right lateral ventricle (1 mm posterior; 1.5 mm lateral; - 3.5 mm depth; flat skull position with bregma as reference), according to the atlas of Paxinos and Watson [24]. The infusion kit was sealed with dental cement and connected to an osmotic pump (1007D, Alzet, Cupertino, CA). The pump was placed in a subcutaneous pocket in the dorsal region. Animals received 0.5 \u03bcl/hr of vehicle or compound for 1 week. Therefore, the dose of sTNFp55R was 0.6 \u03bcg/day per each animal. The compounds began to be immediately infused after surgery. Since the volume of vasogenic edema peaked at 2-3 days after SE in our previous studies [5-8,20], we chose this time point. Thus, our experimental schedules at least inhibit the function of TNF-\u03b1 from 3 days prior to SE to 4 days after SE when the volume of vasogenic edema peaked.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":110,"end":125},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":128,"end":135},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":212,"end":219},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1050,"end":1057},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1341,"end":1346},"obj":"Protein"}]}
