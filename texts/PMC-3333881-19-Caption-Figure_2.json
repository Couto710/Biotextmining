HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with p3xFLAG-Tat or p3xFLAG empty vector (5\u2009\u00b5g), and 48\u2009h later were stimulated with PMA (5\u2009min, 20\u2009ng/ml) or left unstimulated, washed twice with DMEM and harvested at the indicated times. Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were prepared for further analysis. (A) Nuclear extracts were analysed for the p65, p50 and FLAG-Tat binding to the NF-\u03baB double-stranded oligonucleotide using the NF-\u03baB Transcription Factor ELISA assay kit (Cayman). (B) Nuclear and cytosolic extracts (20\u2009\u00b5g) were separated by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and analysed by western blotting using the anti-p65, anti-FLAG, anti-Histone H1, anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 and anti-Hexokinase-II antibodies. Densitometry values (D) of the bands were expressed as fold increase above the control (lane 1). (C) IKK activity was measured in cytosolic extracts (100\u2009\u00b5g) by using HTScan IKK kinase assay (Cell Signaling Technology). (D) HeLa cells (5\u2009\u00d7\u2009106) were transfected with or without p3xFLAG-Tat (5\u2009\u00b5g); 48\u2009h later, cells were stimulated with PMA (5\u2009min, 20\u2009ng/ml) or left unstimulated, washed twice with DMEM, and harvested after 240\u2009min. Whole cell extracts (1\u2009mg) were immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose-coupled anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibody. Immunocomplexes were separated by 12% SDS\u2013PAGE and analysed by western blotting with anti-p65, anti-FLAG and anti-I\u03baB-\u03b1 antibodies. Densitometry values (D) of the bands were expressed as fold increase above the control (lane 1). Values (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE, n\u2009=\u20093) are shown.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":61,"end":72},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":78,"end":83},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":175,"end":178},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":462,"end":465},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":467,"end":470},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":475,"end":483},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":484,"end":491},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":484,"end":491},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":484,"end":491},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1087,"end":1090},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1291,"end":1300},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
