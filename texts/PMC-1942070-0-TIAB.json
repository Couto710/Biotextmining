Previously we have shown that PKDs have an essential role in regulating class II histone deacetylases in DT40 B-cells [Matthews, S.A., Liu, P., Spitaler, M., Olson, E.N., McKinsey, T.A., Cantrell, D.A. and Scharenberg, A.M. (2006) Essential role for protein kinase D family kinases in the regulation of class II histone deacetylases in B lymphocytes. Mol. Cell Biol. 26, 1569\u20131577]. We now show that PKDs are also required to regulate HSP27 phosphorylation in DT40 B-cells. However, in contrast to previous observations in other cell types, PKD enzymes do not regulate basic cellular processes such as proliferation or survival responses, nor NF\u03baB transcriptional activity downstream of the B cell antigen receptor. Thus, PKDs have a selective role in DT40 B-cell biology.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":667,"end":675},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":679,"end":687},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":688,"end":693},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":694,"end":709},"obj":"Phosphorylation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
