After incubation for 15\u2009min on ice, swollen cells were pressed 10 times through a syringe with a 26G needle and centrifuged at 5000 r.p.m. for 5\u2009min. Pellets contained the nuclei and were washed in buffer A for two times and resuspended in 50\u2009\u00b5l buffer C (20\u2009mM HEPES pH 7.9, 400\u2009mM NaCl, 1\u2009mM EDTA, 1\u2009mM EGTA 1\u2009mM DTT, 1\u2009mM PMSF). After shaking for 30\u2009min at 4\u00b0C and centrifugation for 10\u2009min at 13 000 r.p.m., supernatants were used as nuclear extracts.\nEMSA probes were generated by annealing the following complementary oligonucleotides: APO-Sp1/3, 5\u2032- CCAGCTGGGCGGGACCACCAGGGGAGGGGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCCCCTCCCCTGGTGGTCCCGCCCAGCTGG-3\u2032; APO-Sp1/3mut, 5\u2032- CCAGCTGTTCGGGACCACCAGGGGAGGGGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- GCCCCTCCCCTGGTGGTCCCGAACAGCTGG-3\u2032 according to standard procedures. Nucleotides differing from the original promoter sequence are shown in bold type. A commercially available Sp1 probe (sc-2502, referred to as Sp1cons) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The double-stranded oligonucleotides were 5\u2032 end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and [\u03b3-32P]ATP (3000\u2009Ci/mmol, Amersham) and purified by using Nick G50 columns (Amersham).\nFor EMSA, 5\u2009\u00b5g of nuclear proteins were preincubated on ice with 2\u2009\u00b5g of poly(dI-dC) (Roche) as an unspecific competitor and 1\u2009\u00b5g of bovine serum albumin in band shift buffer (50\u2009mM Tris, 150\u2009mM KCl, 5\u2009mM EDTA, 2.5\u2009mM dithiothreitol, 20% Ficoll) for 15\u2009min. 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (50 000\u2009c.p.m.) were added in a total volume of 20\u2009\u00b5l, incubated on ice for 20\u2009min and loaded onto 5% native polyacrylamide gels in 0.5\u00d7Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Upon fractionation, gels were dried and exposed for autoradiography. For competition experiments, 1- or 30-fold molar excess of the unlabeled APO-Sp1/3 or APO-Sp1/3mut oligonucleotides was added to the preincubation mixture. For supershift experiments, 2\u2009\u00b5g Sp1 antibody (sc-59x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Sp3 antibody (sc-644x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the preincubation mixture and preincubation time was extended to 30\u2009min.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":789,"end":792},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":880,"end":883},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1111,"end":1114},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1263,"end":1287},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1534,"end":1554},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1995,"end":1998},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":2008,"end":2011},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":2107,"end":2110},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":2158,"end":2161},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
