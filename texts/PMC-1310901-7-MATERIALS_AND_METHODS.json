Bisulfite treatment of DNA, leading to conversion of unmethylated cytosine to uracil residues and no change of methylated cytosine residues, was performed as described as follows. Briefly, 1 \u00b5g of DNA and 2 \u00b5g of poly(dA\u2013dT)(poly(dA\u2013dT) copolymers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were denaturated for 20 min at 42\u00b0C in 0.3 M NaOH in a volume of 50 \u00b5l. Fresh solutions of 30 \u00b5l of 10 mM hydrochinon (Sigma) and 530 \u00b5l of 3 M sodium bisulfite (pH 5.0; Sigma) were added, the solution was gently mixed, overlayed with mineral oil and incubated in the dark for 12\u201313 h at 50\u00b0C. The aqueous phase was recovered using the \u2018Wizard DNA clean-up system\u2019 (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The purified DNA was subsequently mixed with 1 M NaOH to a final concentration of 0.3 M and incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C to ensure complete desulfonisation. DNA was ethanol precipitated in the presence of 1/10 vol of 3 M sodium acetate, washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 50 \u00b5l H2O. Subsequent PCR amplification of 4 \u00b5l bisulfite-treated DNA was used for cloning of two fragments of the IRF-4 promoter (BS-I and BS-II) into pCR2.1 vector with the \u2018TOPO TA cloning kit\u2019 (Invitrogen) (see Figure 3A). The primers used for PCR amplification of the BS-I and BS-II fragments contain the putative altered sequence of the sense strand due to bisulfite treatment (converted cytosine residues are written in bold letters): BS-I-forward 5\u2032-TATTTGGATTTTTAGGGAGTTTTTTTT-3\u2032, BS-I-reverse 5\u2032-ACCCAACTCCCTTAAACTATTAAACT-3\u2032 (187 bp); BS-II-forward 5\u2032-AGTTTAATAGTTTAAGGGAGTTGGGT-3\u2032, BS-II-reverse 5\u2032-CTCACCCTAAACTCAAAACTAAAAAC-3\u2032 (674 bp). After bacterial amplification of the cloned PCR fragments by standard procedures, eight clones from each sample were sequenced with an automated sequencer (ABI Prism 377, Applied Biosystems).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1125,"end":1130},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
