Since conventional PKC activity was important in regulating M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB activation, we next investigated whether I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation was regulated by PKC. Cells were treated with cyclohexamide (CHX) to inhibit protein synthesis of I\u03baB\u03b1, and its degradation was followed. As shown in Figure 5A, PKC inhibition with Ro-31-8220 did not alter M-CSF-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, suggesting that M-CSF-induced PKC activity augmented NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity by an alternative pathway, like post-translational modification of NF-\u03baB p65.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":43,"end":51},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":72,"end":75},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":76,"end":86},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":136,"end":151},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":156,"end":167},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":171,"end":175},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":242,"end":245},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":360,"end":365},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":421,"end":425},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":426,"end":437},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":442,"end":451},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":507,"end":514},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":523,"end":532},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":536,"end":540},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":638,"end":643},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":644,"end":649},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":650,"end":657},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":658,"end":662},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":663,"end":674},"obj":"Protein_catabolism"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":692,"end":697},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":719,"end":728},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":792,"end":823},"obj":"Protein_modification"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":833,"end":836},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E6"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E9"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
