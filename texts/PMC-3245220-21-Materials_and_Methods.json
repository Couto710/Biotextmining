The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris, 5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 20 mM \u03b2-glycerol phosphate, 1 mM PMSF 2 \u00b5g/ml aprotinin and 2 \u00b5g/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5), sonicated and centrifuged to obtain whole cell lysates, which were then immunoprecipitated with anti-PKC\u03b1 antibody and protein G-agarose (Invitrogen). Immune complexes were washed twice, and PKC\u03b1 activity was analyzed by non-radioactive Peptag assay kit (Promega). Briefly, kinase buffer, activator, peptide protection solution and Peptag peptide were incubated with the immune complexes at 30\u00b0C for 30 minutes. Reactions were stopped by boiling for 10 minutes and samples were separated on 0.8% agarose gel. Phosphorylated peptide migrated toward the anode (+), while non-phosphorylated peptide migrated toward the cathode (\u2212). Fluorescein-tagged peptides were visualized by UV light.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":16},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":93,"end":98},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":528,"end":532},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
