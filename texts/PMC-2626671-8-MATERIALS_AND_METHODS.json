Anti-CD69 was purchased from BD. For ChIP experiments, the anti-Eomes antibody was obtained from Abcam and the anti-Runx3 antibody was produced by the Groner laboratory. The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: antiperforin (Abcam), anti-Eomes (Abcam), and anti\u2013Pol-II (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The T-bet antibody was provided by L. Glimcher (Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA).\nThe following reagents were used for the experiments presented in this report: Annexin V\u2013FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD), CD8 Negative Isolation Kit (Invitrogen), CD8 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec), and SYBR Green PCR Core Reagents (Applied Biosystems). The Gp33 peptide (KAVYNFATC) was synthesized by the Tufts University Core Facility, and 10 mM of stock solutions was prepared in DMSO.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":128,"end":132},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":139,"end":144},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":151,"end":154},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":161,"end":171},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":178,"end":181},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":188,"end":192},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":203,"end":207},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":214,"end":218},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":273,"end":278},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":325,"end":330},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":438,"end":446},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":461,"end":466},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":530,"end":535},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":699,"end":708},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":744,"end":747},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":785,"end":788},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
