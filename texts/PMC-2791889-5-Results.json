For this, CD4+ T\u00a0cells were differentiated for 2 consecutive weeks with high antigen doses in the presence or absence of IL-12 throughout (Figures 4A\u20134D). High antigen dose and IL-12 cooperated to induce maximal IL-10 production (Figures 4A and 4B), given that this combination resulted in the highest numbers of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Repeated high antigen dose stimulation in the absence of exogenously added IL-12 resulted in the production of IL-10 by Th1 cells, suggesting that repeated strong TCR triggering may overcome the need for IL-12 for IL-10 induction (Figures 4C and 4D). However, IL-10 induction under these conditions was abrogated when IL-12p40-deficient DCs were used as APCs (Figure\u00a04E). Thus, IL-12 is essential during both primary and secondary antigenic stimulation for production of IL-10 by Th1 cells.\nTo determine the requirements for stability of the IL-10-producing Th1 cells, we differentiated CD4+ T\u00a0cells for 1 week with high antigen doses with or without IL-12 (Figures 4A and 4C), washed them, and then restimulated them for an additional week with a low antigen dose, in the absence or presence of IL-12 (Figure\u00a04F). Th1 cells induced in the first week to produce IL-10 by culture with high antigen doses and IL-12 lost their ability to express IL-10 when recultured with low doses of OVA, which could be compensated for, to some extent, by addition of IL-12 to the secondary cultures (Figure\u00a04F), again suggesting that antigen dose and IL-12 signals cooperate for the induction of IL-10. Finally, DO11.10 CD4+ cells that were exposed to low doses of antigen and IL-12 during the primary differentiation phase produced high amounts of IFN-\u03b3 but little IL-10, but they could be induced to produce IL-10 when both high antigen dose and IL-12 were present during the recall phase (Figure\u00a0S4). Thus, high antigen dose and IL-12 are required for sustaining the induction of IL-10 production by Th1 cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":6,"end":16},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":20,"end":30},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":63,"end":68},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":158,"end":163},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":172,"end":177},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":195,"end":204},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":208,"end":213},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":238,"end":241},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":349,"end":354},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":405,"end":410},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":425,"end":431},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":440,"end":445},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":446,"end":456},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":541,"end":546},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":547,"end":556},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":643,"end":648},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":649,"end":657},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":665,"end":675},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":679,"end":684},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":763,"end":767},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":772,"end":777},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":782,"end":787},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":788,"end":797},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":828,"end":833},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":834,"end":843},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":871,"end":880},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":886,"end":894},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":895,"end":904},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":946,"end":951},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":955,"end":964},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1025,"end":1035},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1039,"end":1044},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1115},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1116,"end":1125},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1155,"end":1158},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1219,"end":1224},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1364,"end":1369},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1393,"end":1400},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1422,"end":1429},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1430,"end":1435},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1475,"end":1480},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1481,"end":1485},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1510},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1511,"end":1516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1551,"end":1554},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1571,"end":1582},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1607,"end":1615},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1624},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1703,"end":1708},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1717,"end":1726},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1735,"end":1744},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1748,"end":1753},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1775},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1829,"end":1834},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1876,"end":1884},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1876,"end":1884},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1901,"end":1906},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1918,"end":1923},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1943,"end":1950},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1954,"end":1961},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1962,"end":1967},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2000,"end":2005},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2084,"end":2089},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":2122,"end":2131},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2135,"end":2140},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":2141,"end":2151},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R12","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R
