Experimental setup (A) and results of the mouse suppression assay (B), FACS-purified naive CD4+8\u2212 T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre (left) and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice (Cd45.2; right) were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAb, 50 U/ml IL-2, and 2.5 ng/ml TGF-\u03b2. After 3 d, Foxp3-GFP+ cells were FACS-sorted and mixed with CFSE-loaded naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells at the indicated ratios. These were then incubated with inactivated splenocytes and anti-CD3 mAb. After a further 4 d, CD45.1+ cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution. (C) As a control, CbfbF/+ CD4-cre CD4+ T cells activated in absence of TGF-\u03b2 were mixed with CFSE-loaded naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells at the indicated ratios. Four days later CD45.1+ cells were analyzed for CFSE dilution. The median division number (of the naive CD45.1+ CD4+ cells in the cultures containing Foxp3-GFP+ cells) is indicated in each of the histograms. One of three experiments is shown. (D) Human naive CD4+ T cells, transfected with RUNX1 and RUNX3 siRNA and cultured under iT reg differentiating conditions were used in an in vitro suppression assay, cultured together with autologous CFSE-labeled CD4+ T cells, and stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb. The CFSE dilution of the CD4+ T cell responder cells was analyzed after 5 d by flow cytometry. The T reg/responder CD4+ T cell ratios used were 1:20, 1:10, and 1:5. One of two experiments is shown.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":8,"end":15},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":72,"end":75},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":102,"end":110},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":102,"end":110},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":111,"end":116},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":121,"end":126},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":127,"end":137},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":127,"end":137},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":269,"end":272},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":273,"end":274},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":289,"end":293},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":297,"end":304},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":324,"end":328},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":332,"end":339},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":346,"end":352},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":395,"end":398},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":399,"end":401},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":415,"end":419},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":435,"end":440},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":453,"end":462},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":520,"end":526},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":528,"end":531},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":628,"end":631},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":658,"end":664},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":723,"end":727},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":731,"end":738},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":739,"end":742},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":776,"end":781},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":816,"end":822},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":824,"end":827},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":876,"end":882},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":964,"end":970},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":972,"end":975},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1019},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1119,"end":1122},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1150,"end":1155},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1160,"end":1165},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1166,"end":1171},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1166,"end":1171},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1319},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1355,"end":1358},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1389,"end":1392},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1479,"end":1482},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T33","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T34","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
