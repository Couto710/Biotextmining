Monocytes used in real time PCR experiments and transfection experiments were purified by positive selection using CD14 Monocyte Isolation Kit from Miltenyi Biotech (Auburn, CA) (\u003E90% pure). In some experiments, monocytes were isolated by clumping method (70% pure). To obtain monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), monocytes were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FBS, and 10 \u00b5g/ml polymyxin B and 20 ng/ml M-CSF.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":317,"end":321},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":618,"end":623},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
