(A) FACS-purified naive CD4+ CD8\u2212 T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were activated in vitro with anti-CD3/28 mAb, 50 U/ml IL-2, \u00b1 10 nM retinoic acid (RA), and increasing concentrations of TGF-\u03b2. After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA + ionomycin, and then analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-\u03b3 expression. One of five experiments is shown. (B) Naive CD4+ T cells from Cbfb CD4-cre or control mice (harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele) were adoptively transferred into Rag-deficient mice (5 \u00d7 106 cells per transfer). 6 wk later, TCR\u03b2+CD4+ cells from the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and lamina propria of the small intestine (LP) were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression. Results from one of four CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice with same findings are shown. The data from four sets of mice is shown in C. Statistical analysis was performed with Mann-Whitney U test. *, P \u003C 0.05 between groups.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":23,"end":27},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":28,"end":37},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":38,"end":45},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":80,"end":85},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":87,"end":90},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":125,"end":128},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":130,"end":133},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":148,"end":152},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":156,"end":163},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":176,"end":180},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":184,"end":191},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":231,"end":234},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":235,"end":237},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":251,"end":255},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":318,"end":323},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":433,"end":438},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":443,"end":448},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":449,"end":459},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":449,"end":459},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":505,"end":508},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":523,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":528,"end":535},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":565,"end":570},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":576,"end":579},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":621,"end":624},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":625,"end":634},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":682,"end":686},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":687,"end":690},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":809,"end":818},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":819,"end":829},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":856,"end":860},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":864,"end":871},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":884,"end":888},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":892,"end":899},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"E5"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
