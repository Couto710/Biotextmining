A positive control for GR association with importin is shown. Quantification of the densitometry data is shown below. Each bar represents mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. *** p\u003C0.001 compared to control, ### p\u003C0.001. (B) Western blot analysis demonstrated a time- (at 10\u22128 M FP) and concentration- (at 60 min after stimulation) dependent induction of FP-activated GR nuclear translocation measured by IP.

(D) GFP-tagged GATA-3 was overexpressed and cells stimulated (b, c) or not (a) for 30 min with anti-CD3/CD28. The effect of 30 min pretreatment of cells with FP (10\u22128 M, c) is also shown. All data were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":23,"end":30},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":23,"end":30},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":31,"end":37},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":38,"end":49},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":70,"end":76},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":77,"end":84},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":85,"end":91},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":204,"end":213},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":214,"end":223},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":230,"end":239},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":240,"end":242},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":243,"end":254},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":303,"end":305},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":306,"end":317},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":627,"end":636},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":637,"end":646},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":653,"end":662},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":663,"end":665},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":666,"end":673},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":674,"end":687},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":984,"end":993},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":994,"end":1002},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1006,"end":1012},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1035},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1273,"end":1279},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1284,"end":1297},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R14","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E16","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E8"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
