Levels of intracellular protein were assessed following 24 h stimulation with PMA (162 nM) or HK E. coli (5 \u00d7 107 CFU/ml). (A) Phospho-PKC increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli stimulation. (B) I\u03baB decreased following stimulation with HK E. coli indicating NF-\u03baB activation. (C) Bcl10 activation was inhibited following long-term stimulation with PMA, which explains the inhibitory effect of PMA on NF-\u03baB activation. \u03b2-actin was used as a loading control.
