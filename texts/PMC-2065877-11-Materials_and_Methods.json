Erythrocytes were lysed using 0.8% ammonium chloride solution (StemCell Technologies) for 10 min on ice and washed twice with PBS. B cells were isolated using CD19-MACS beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec) and grown in Iscove's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotic/antimycotic (GIBCO). Splenocytes isolated from SCID-passaged lymphomas consisted of 80%\u201390% B cells as determined by flow cytometry, and were hence not further purified with CD19-MACS beads. Splenocytes were seeded at 1.25 \u00d7 106 cells/ml and where applicable, recombinant mouse IL4 was added at 100 ng/ml, recombinant mouse IL10 at 10 ng/ml, and rat IgG1 anti-mouse IL10 and rat IgG1 isotype control at 10 \u03bcg/ml (R\u0026D Systems). For BrdU incorporation assays, splenocytes were pulsed for 24 h with 10 \u03bcM BrdU 1 d post-harvest.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":328,"end":332},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":683,"end":687},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":787,"end":790},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":833,"end":837},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":875,"end":879},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
