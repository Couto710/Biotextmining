In most cases, experiments were reproduced with each type of purified CD4+ T\u00a0cell population with similar results obtained. Splenic DCs were prepared as described (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), and sort purified CD11c+ cells were added to the T\u00a0cell culture. Purified DO11.10 CD4+ T\u00a0cells (1 \u00d7 105 cells/ml) were cultured as before (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), in a total volume of 1 ml cRPMI medium in a 48-well plate, with splenic DCs (2 \u00d7 104 cells/ml), and varying amounts of OVA and of IL-12. APC-independent differentiation of naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells into Th1 and Th2 cells used stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and appropriate cytokine conditions, and control Th1 and Th2 cells were cultured as described before (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995; Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006). Culture conditions for Th17 cells were as described before (Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2006). Importantly, Th1 and Th2 cells could be differentiated in cRPMI or IMDM (Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995; Shoemaker et\u00a0al., 2006; Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2006), but Th17 cells were only differentiated optimally in IMDM (Veldhoen et\u00a0al., 2009). When indicated, U0126 or PD184352 (MEK inhibitors), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor), CT99021 (GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor), or a similar amount of DMSO were present in the culture. More details of specific culture conditions are provided in Figures S6 and S7.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":16},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":122,"end":125},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":126,"end":131},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":135,"end":138},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":139,"end":144},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":146,"end":150},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":156,"end":159},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":160,"end":164},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":166,"end":170},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":343,"end":346},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":477,"end":482},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":541,"end":544},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":739,"end":742},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":750,"end":755},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":798,"end":801},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":861,"end":864},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":874,"end":878},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1371,"end":1374},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":1375,"end":1385},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1398,"end":1401},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":1402,"end":1411},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1423,"end":1428},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":1429,"end":1438},"obj":"Negative_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
