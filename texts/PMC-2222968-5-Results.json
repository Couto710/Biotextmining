It is known that IL-4 is a potent growth factor and may therefore favor the proliferation of FOXP3\u2013 cells and thus decrease the relative percentage of FOXP3+ cells. However, analysis of cell division kinetics by CFSE-labeling demonstrated that IL-4 did not differentially promote cell growth of FOXP3+ over that of FOXP3\u2013. In fact both populations showed similarly enhanced proliferation (Figure 6A). Furthermore the TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated induction of FOXP3 expression was not caused by overgrowth of a CD25\u2013FOXP3+ minority, since the number of FOXP3+ cells was low/absent in the purified CD4+CD45RA+ T cells (between 0% and 1%), and the FOXP3+ cells were not confined to the highly divided cells. CD25 was down-regulated in TGF-\u03b2\u2013treated cells compare to activated T cells, which was even more pronounced in cells cultured with TGF-\u03b2 and IL-4.\nThe addition of IL-4 to iTreg-driving conditions decreased the number of FOXP3+ cells (Figure 6B). In line with the previous findings, the IL-4\u2013producing cells and the FOXP3 expressing cells are nonoverlapping populations. Since FOXP3 is known to act as a repressor of cytokine expression [20], we therefore analyzed GATA3 and FOXP3 expression. The expression kinetic of naive T cells exposed to IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2 demonstrated that GATA3 and FOXP3 are initially found in separate populations (day 2), but transiently co-express both factors (days 4\u20138), before establishing separate populations at the end of the differentiation process (day 10; Figure 6C), suggesting that GATA3 inhibits the development of iTreg cells by repressing FOXP3.\nThese results showed that IL-4 acts in vitro as an inhibitor of FOXP3 expression, without interfering with TGF-\u03b2 signaling, probably acting at the level of transcription factors, and possibly by a GATA3-dependent mechanism.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":17},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":53,"end":58},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":59,"end":66},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":59,"end":66},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":59,"end":66},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":67,"end":71},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":73,"end":77},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":78,"end":88},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":78,"end":88},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":94,"end":98},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":99,"end":109},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":123,"end":127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":142,"end":151},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":152,"end":157},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":167,"end":176},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":180,"end":185},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":217,"end":222},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":289,"end":293},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":365,"end":370},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":423,"end":428},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":516,"end":520},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":567,"end":572},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":587,"end":592},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":689,"end":694},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":704,"end":713},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":717,"end":722},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":723,"end":733},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":742,"end":748},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":768,"end":772},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":773,"end":778},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":810,"end":815},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":854,"end":857},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":858,"end":864},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":903,"end":908},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":963,"end":967},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":972,"end":986},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":990,"end":995},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1060,"end":1070},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1094,"end":1099},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1126,"end":1130},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1183,"end":1188},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1249,"end":1253},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1254,"end":1263},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1278,"end":1283},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1284,"end":1294},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1339,"end":1344},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1427,"end":1432},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1437,"end":1442},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1443,"end":1453},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1443,"end":1453},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1506,"end":1510},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1515,"end":1520},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1533},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1533},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1533},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1533},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1539,"end":1544},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1549,"end":1554},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1624,"end":1634},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1624,"end":1634},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1780,"end":1785},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1829,"end":1839},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1840,"end":1845},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1873,"end":1877},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1878,"end":1907},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1911,"end":1916},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1917,"end":1927},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1954,"end":1959},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1980,"end":1986},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":2044,"end":2049},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":2050,"end":2059},"obj":"Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R15","pred":"
