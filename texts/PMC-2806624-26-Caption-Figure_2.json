(A) Real-time PCR analysis of CD4+, CD127\u2212, and CD25high T reg cells and CD4+, CD127+, and CD25neg T cells isolated from human peripheral blood showed an increased expression of IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, FOXP3, and RUNX3 mRNA in CD25+ compared with CD25\u2212 cells. Bars show the mean \u00b1 SE of three independent experiments. (B) Human tonsil sections were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Tissue sections were stained for FOXP3, RUNX1, RUNX3, and DAPI or isotype controls. HEK cells RUNX1-transfected or not transfected served as additional control for RUNX1 staining. Data shown are representative from one of the three tissue samples with similar results. Bars, 5 \u00b5m. Statistical differences were verified by the paired Student's t test. *, P \u003C 0.05; **, P \u003C 0.01.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":10,"end":15},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":16,"end":26},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":16,"end":26},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":30,"end":35},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":62,"end":65},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":68,"end":73},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":76,"end":80},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":122,"end":125},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":128,"end":133},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":140,"end":144},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":165,"end":168},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":171,"end":176},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":183,"end":187},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":246,"end":255},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":246,"end":255},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":246,"end":255},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":246,"end":255},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":256,"end":266},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":256,"end":266},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":256,"end":266},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":256,"end":266},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":270,"end":275},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":277,"end":282},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":284,"end":289},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":295,"end":300},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":309,"end":313},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":329,"end":333},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":497,"end":502},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":504,"end":509},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":511,"end":516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":548,"end":557},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":558,"end":563},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":564,"end":575},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":583,"end":594},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":628,"end":633},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E12"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
