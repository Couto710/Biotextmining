Cells were stimulated in accordance with the schedule in Figure 1. In CF, airway epithelial cells have been shown to possess a hyper-inflammatory phenotype and produce an exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine response [4], [5]. To determine if airway epithelial cells contribute to the increased IL-1\u03b2 production in patients with CF, CF and control bronchial epithelial cell lines were stimulated with the inflammasome inducers P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 (PAO1) and LPS followed by ATP. IL-1\u03b2 levels in cell culture supernatants were not greatly increased in either the CF or control cell lines (Fig. 2a\u2013d), although a small increase in IL-1\u03b2 production was detected in NuLi-1 and CuFi-1 cells, but not in S9 and IB3-1 cells, by 24 hours. In contrast, these airway cells were highly responsive to other inflammatory stimuli, such as recombinant IL-1\u03b2, producing large quantities of IL-8 (Fig. 2a\u2013d inserts).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":31,"end":38},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":62,"end":67},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":68,"end":82},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":472,"end":482},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":490,"end":499},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":500,"end":505},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":506,"end":516},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":690,"end":695},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":749,"end":758},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":828,"end":836},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":840,"end":845},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":846,"end":856},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1048,"end":1053},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E8"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
