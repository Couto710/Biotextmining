For IL4 studies, splenocytes were cultured for 3 d in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml IL4. Cells were seeded on day 3 in triplicate in a 96-well plate at 2.5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml at 100 \u03bcl per well. MTS reagent was added for 4 h and absorbance was read at 540 nm; values plotted were subtracted from blanks. For neutralization assays, splenocytes were seeded at 5 \u00d7 106 cells/ml at 100 \u03bcl per well on day of harvest and IL4, rat IgG1 anti-mouse IL4, or rat IgG1 isotype control (R\u0026D Systems) were added at the concentrations indicated in the figures. Cultures were pulsed for 4 h with MTS reagent 1 d post-seeding. For inhibitor studies, splenocytes were seeded at 1 \u00d7 107 cells/ml at 100 \u03bcl per well on day of harvest, and inhibitors were added at the concentrations indicated in the figures. The inhibitors BAY11\u20137085, rapamycin, triciribine, U0126, SB202190, and cucurbitacin I were purchased from EMD Biosciences. For non-malignant splenocyte cultures, B cell activation was induced with 10 \u03bcg/ml of goat F(ab') anti-mouse IgM (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Cultures were pulsed for 4 h with MTS reagent 1 d post-seeding.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":302,"end":305},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":389,"end":392},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":717,"end":720},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":742,"end":745},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
