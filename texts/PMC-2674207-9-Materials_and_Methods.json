In brief, 5 \u00b5g of nuclear extracts were incubated with a plate coated with an NF-\u03baB consensus oligonucleotide. Plates were washed before addition of an anti-p65 antibody. Antibody binding was detected with a secondary HRP-conjugated antibody and developed with TMB substrate. The intensity of the reaction was measured at 450 nm.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":110,"end":113},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
