DNA was extracted from 1 \u00d7 106 cells using Puregene DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States), and 100 ng of the sample DNA solution was analyzed by this system. The HTLV-I proviral DNA load was calculated by the following formula: copy number of HTLV-I (pX) per 100 cells = (copy number of pX)/(copy number of \u03b2-actin/2) \u00d7 100.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":49,"end":52},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":450,"end":457},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
