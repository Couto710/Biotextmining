Interestingly, adding M-CSF did not alter NF-\u03baB DNA binding by EMSA. In contrast, after transiently transfecting human MDMs with pNF-\u03baB-SEAP constructs containing four NF-\u03baB consensus binding sequences, M-CSF treatment of the transfected cells resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in SEAP release in the culture media compared to PBS (vehicle)-treated transfected MDMs (Figure 1B). As a control, the pTAL-SEAP construct lacking NF-\u03baB binding sites was used. Cells transfected with the pTAL-SEAP construct did not produce SEAP in the absence or presence of M-CSF (Figure 1B).\nWe next investigated whether M-CSF induced NF-\u03baB activity in the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with either the NF-\u03baB-SEAP reporter or control pTAL-SEAP construct. As shown in Figure 1C, M-CSF treatment of RAW 264.7 cells increased NF-\u03baB reporter activity by 2.5-fold over that of non-treated cells. Together, our data demonstrate that M-CSF induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in macrophages.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":148,"end":153},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":253,"end":258},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":409,"end":414},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":590,"end":595},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":938,"end":943},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":986,"end":991},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1190},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":1220,"end":1229},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1230,"end":1235},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1253},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1334,"end":1339},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
