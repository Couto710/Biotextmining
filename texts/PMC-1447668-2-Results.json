We analyzed the effect of Foxp3 overexpression on NF-\u03baB activation in HEK 293T cells in dose-response and time course analyses. Transfection of HEK 293T cells with an NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter vector in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of a Foxp3 expression vector or a control vector (enhanced green fluorescent protein [EGFP]) was performed, and cells were harvested after 24 h to assay for luciferase activity and Foxp3 mRNA expression. Results indicated that as the concentration of Foxp3 transfected into cells increases (from 50 to 2,400 ng), the level of NF-\u03baB activation decreases proportionally (Figure 1A). Foxp3 mRNA was also assayed to monitor activity of the Foxp3 expression vector (Figure 1B). Since NF-\u03baB activation was partially affected by transfection of high concentrations of the control vector, we determined the fold inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation by Foxp3 compared to the control vector at each concentration (Figure 1A). Fold inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation was directly proportional to the level of Foxp3 mRNA expression detected by real-time RT-PCR. To determine the level of Foxp3-mediated suppression of NF-\u03baB activation over time, HEK 293T cells were transfected with an NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter vector and an expression vector encoding Foxp3 or EGFP (control vector) and harvested over 4 d. As shown in Figure 1C, NF-\u03baB activation was suppressed by overexpression of Foxp3 at all time points. Extending these results from established, in vitro HEK cell lines to primary human lymphocytes, overexpression of Foxp3 in purified CD4+ T cells from three healthy donors also down-regulated the steady-state level of NF-\u03baB activation (Figure 1D). These results recapitulate those from Bettelli and colleagues [15] demonstrating that Foxp3 functions, in part, to block NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription in human cell lines as well as in primary human CD4+ T cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":107,"end":112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":161,"end":164},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":165,"end":169},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":216,"end":221},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":362,"end":367},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":372,"end":378},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":415,"end":420},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":421,"end":435},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":562,"end":572},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":650,"end":655},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":656,"end":666},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":704,"end":729},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":802,"end":812},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":826,"end":831},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":832,"end":847},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":879,"end":892},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":896,"end":901},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":925,"end":934},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1026,"end":1031},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1081,"end":1086},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1087,"end":1097},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1283,"end":1288},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1433,"end":1438},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1439,"end":1454},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1511,"end":1516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1615,"end":1625},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1649,"end":1659},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1676,"end":1681},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1789,"end":1803},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1807,"end":1812},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1929,"end":1943},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1947,"end":1952},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1965,"end":1968},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2166,"end":2171},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2279,"end":2282},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
