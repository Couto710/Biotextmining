Furthermore, we report that BMP-6 has an antiproliferative effect in B cells stimulated with anti-IgM alone or the combined action of anti-IgM and CD40L. Additionally, BMP-6 induces cell death in activated memory B cells and Ramos cells. Taken together, these results provide a rationale to further examine the role of BMP-6 signalling in normal B cell biology as well as in pathologic conditions like B cell malignancies and autoimmune disorders.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":37,"end":42},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":124,"end":135},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":136,"end":146},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":150,"end":153},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":191,"end":196},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":310,"end":315},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":331,"end":336},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":482,"end":487},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
