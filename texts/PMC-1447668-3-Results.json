Unlike full-length Foxp3, which localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus and can bind in a sequence-specific manner to forkhead binding sites, the \u0394FKH mutant fails to localize to the nucleus and thus cannot interact with promoter elements or nuclear proteins [16]. Therefore, we utilized the \u0394FKH mutant to determine whether nuclear localization (or other function associated with the FKH domain) of Foxp3 was a prerequisite for inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. Although Foxp3 interaction with NF-\u03baB presumably takes place in the nucleus, it may also be possible for a cytoplasmic Foxp3 protein to bind to NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm and prevent localization to the nucleus following an activation stimulus. Overexpression of full-length Foxp3, but not of \u0394FKH, was able to suppress activation of a cotransfected NF-\u03baB reporter vector in HEK 293T cells (Figure 2B). Both Foxp3 and \u0394FKH were expressed at very high levels following transfection as detected by real-time RT-PCR (unpublished data). These data appear to suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain is critically important for Foxp3 to down-regulate NF-\u03baB-dependent transcription. However, NF-\u03baB activation was blocked to a similar extent by both full-length Foxp3 and \u0394FKH in Jurkat T cells (Figure 2C) and primary human CD4+ T cells (Figure 2D). Western blot analysis of NF-\u03baB p65 expression demonstrated that Foxp3 and \u0394FKH does not block NF-\u03baB activation at the level of p65 protein expression (Figure 2E). These results are very interesting with respect to Foxp3 function, because they suggest that the carboxyl-terminal FKH domain, and possibly nuclear localization, are dispensable for Foxp3 function in T cell populations. Alternative interpretations may include the possibility that the localization of \u0394FKH differ between epithelial cells and T cells. In either case, these results suggest a cell type-specific mechanism of action for this Foxp3 mutant.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":126,"end":131},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":217,"end":222},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":223,"end":230},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":235,"end":245},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":293,"end":298},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":321,"end":326},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":393,"end":398},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":406,"end":415},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":442,"end":449},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":458,"end":462},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":524,"end":535},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":545,"end":553},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":561,"end":568},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":585,"end":593},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":670,"end":681},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":703,"end":710},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":711,"end":723},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":778,"end":783},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":848,"end":853},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":854,"end":865},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":958,"end":963},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":975,"end":979},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1010,"end":1017},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1018,"end":1030},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1038,"end":1045},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1055},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1094},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1094},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1110,"end":1115},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1132},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1243,"end":1248},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1253,"end":1257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1263,"end":1272},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1263,"end":1272},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1293,"end":1302},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1293,"end":1302},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1463,"end":1468},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1595,"end":1600},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1605,"end":1609},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1658,"end":1661},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1715,"end":1718},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1719,"end":1729},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1748,"end":1753},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1758,"end":1762},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1777},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1772,"end":1777},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1811,"end":1814},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1823,"end":1833},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1898,"end":1903},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":1987,"end":1994},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1995,"end":2007},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2029,"end":2034},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":2132,"end":2144},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2148,"end":2152},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2286,"end":2291},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T36","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R18","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T42","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E20","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R28","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R29","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T29","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R30","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E20","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R31","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R32","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R33","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T50","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R34","pred":"themeOf","s
