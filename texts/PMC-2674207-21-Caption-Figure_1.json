(B) Histone H1 and MEK-1 were used to confirm distinct separation of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts in three separate experiments. (C) Western blot analysis of FP-treated HuT-78 cells demonstrated impaired nuclear localization of GATA-3 induced by anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation in a time- (at 10\u22128 M FP) and concentration- (at 60 min after stimulation) dependent manner. Cells were pretreated with FP for 30 min prior to stimulation. MEK1 and histone H1 were used to demonstrate equal cytoplasmic and nuclear loading respectively. Results are presented graphically below as mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. *** p\u003C0.001 compared to t\u200a=\u200a0. (D) RT-PCR showing that FP inhibits IL-4 and IL-5 mRNA expression in CD3/CD28-costimulated cells. GAPDH was used as a loading control. Lower panels show graphical analysis of results presented as mean\u00b1SEM of at least three independent experiments. ###p\u003C0.001 compared to control, ***p\u003C0.001 compared to anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated. (E) FP (10 nM) reduces the ability of anti-CD3/CD28-stimulated GATA-3 to associate with the native IL-5 promoter 60 min after stimulation. Data are also shown graphically as mean\u00b1SEM of three independent experiments. All data were analysed by ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post-test.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":71,"end":79},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":80,"end":86},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":87,"end":94},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":95,"end":101},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":158,"end":171},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":175,"end":181},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":208,"end":215},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":250,"end":255},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":439,"end":446},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":447,"end":459},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":463,"end":469},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":470,"end":477},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":666,"end":670},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":916,"end":924},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":916,"end":924},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":925,"end":929},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":934,"end":938},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":939,"end":954},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":939,"end":954},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":958,"end":961},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":962,"end":966},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":967,"end":979},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":967,"end":979},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1233,"end":1240},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1270,"end":1280},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1281,"end":1287},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1291,"end":1300},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1321},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1322,"end":1330},"obj":"Entity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T26","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R18","pred":"partOf","subj":"T26","obj":"T11"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R7","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E6"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
