Five different Silencer or Silencer Select Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX1 (Applied Biosystems) and three Silencer Pre-designed siRNAs for RUNX3 (Applied Biosystems) were tested, and the best was selected for all further experiments. The Silencer Negative Control #1 siRNA (Applied Biosystems) was used for normalization. Cells were then left unstimulated or were stimulated after 12 h with anti-CD2, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28. Cells were cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium with the addition of 1 nmol/l IL-2 (Roche). Cells were harvested for mRNA detection of the target genes after 24 h and for protein detection after 48 h.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":32,"end":35},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":252,"end":258},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":263,"end":268},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":322,"end":328},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":333,"end":338},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":590,"end":593},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":600,"end":603},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":614,"end":618},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":654,"end":659},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":697,"end":701},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
