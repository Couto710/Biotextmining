Reporter plasmid (pNF\u03baB-Luc, pAP1 (PMA)-TA-Luc, pNF\u03baB-SEAP), internal control plasmid (pRL) (Promega, USA) and lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, USA) were added to each well at 0.54 \u03bcg/well, 0.06 \u03bcg/well and 1.5 \u03bcl/well, respectively. Initially, the reporter plasmid and pRL were mixed separately with OptiMEM (Gibco, USA). After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, lipofectamine 2000 was added and the mixture was incubated further for 20 min at room temperature. The transfection was allowed to proceed overnight at 37\u00b0C, after which, the cells were centrifuged, the media removed and fresh pre-warmed media added. The cells were pre-incubated with NF-\u03baB, JNK and PKC inhibitors and stimulated in 24-well plates with different concentrations of PMA, HK E. coli MG1655 and Calcium Ionophore A23187.\nThe cells were lysed and luciferase activity (NF-\u03baB and AP-1) was measured using the Dual-Luciferase\u00ae reporter assay system (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions on a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Secreted alkaline phosphatase (NF\u03baB-SEAP, figure 4a, b) levels were measured using Great EscAPe\u2122 SEAP Detection Kit (Clontech, USA).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1340},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":1341,"end":1349},"obj":"Positive_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
