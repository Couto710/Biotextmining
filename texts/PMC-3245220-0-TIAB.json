The transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) is a key regulator of genes involved in M-CSF-induced mononuclear phagocyte survival and this study focused at identifying the mechanism of NF-\u03baB transcriptional activation. Here, we demonstrate that M-CSF stimulated NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. The general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro-31-8220, the conventional PKC\u03b1/\u03b2 inhibitor G\u00f6-6976, overexpression of dominant negative PKC\u03b1 constructs and PKC\u03b1 siRNA reduced NF-\u03baB activity in response to M-CSF. Interestingly, Ro-31-8220 reduced Ser276 phosphorylation of NF-\u03baBp65 leading to decreased M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. In this report, we identify conventional PKCs, including PKC\u03b1 as important upstream kinases for M-CSF-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activation, NF-\u03baB-regulated gene expression, NF-\u03baB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation, and macrophage survival. Lastly, we find that NF-\u03baB p65 Ser276 plays an important role in basal and M-CSF-stimulated NF-\u03baB activation in human mononuclear phagocytes.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":6,"end":13},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":35,"end":45},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":52,"end":55},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":56,"end":71},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":75,"end":81},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":103,"end":139},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":141,"end":146},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":302,"end":307},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":462,"end":467},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":676,"end":680},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":681,"end":682},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":683,"end":692},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":683,"end":692},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":702,"end":716},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":720,"end":742},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":758,"end":768},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":807,"end":812},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":840,"end":847},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":848,"end":854},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":855,"end":870},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":879,"end":882},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":904,"end":909},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":994,"end":998},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1002,"end":1011},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1038},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1039,"end":1046},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1120,"end":1123},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1130},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1131,"end":1146},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1203},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1204,"end":1210},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1248,"end":1253},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R12","pred":"partOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"T22"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R15","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"T21"},{"id":"R16","pred":"partOf","subj":"T31","obj":"T9"},{"id":"R17","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T24","obj":"T23"},{"id":"R2","pred":"partOf","subj":"T11","obj":"T1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"partOf","subj":"T15","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
