As probes, we radioactively labeled the unmodified E2 sequence (nucleotides \u221292/\u221263 of the A3G promoter, probe designated APO-Sp1/3) or the same region carrying the two point mutations described above (probe designated APO-Sp1/3mut). As control, we used a commercially available Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (Sp1cons), which is known to be recognized by Sp1 transcription factors. Four DNA\u2013protein complexes were observed in the presence of the APO-Sp1/3 probe (Figure 6A). The upper two complexes were specific since they disappeared in the presence of a 30-fold molar excess of unlabeled APO-Sp1/3 probe (Figure 6A, lane 7). Further confirmation of the specificity of these DNA\u2013protein complexes was demonstrated by the inability of the unlabeled APO-Sp1/3mut probe to abolish binding (Figure 6A, lanes 12 and 13). As expected, the two specific complexes were also present in the case of the Sp1cons control probe (Figure 6A, lanes 2 and 3). In contrast, none of these specific complexes was observed when the mutated probe was used (Figure 6A, lanes 10 and 11), confirming that protein binding was dependent on the identified GC-box. In order to characterize the complexes, we performed supershift experiments using Sp1- and Sp3-specific antibodies. The upper of the complexes that appeared in combination with the Sp1cons or APO-Sp1/3 probes, shifted in the presence of the Sp1 antibody (Figure 6B, lanes 3 and 7), whereas the lower complex shifted in the presence of the Sp3 antibody (Figure 6B, lanes 4 and 8). Taken together, the EMSA demonstrated that the GC-box located on the A3G core promoter serves as a binding site for Sp1 and Sp3.\nTo show binding of Sp1 and Sp3 factors also in the context of the endogenous A3G promoter, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed. Sp1 and Sp3 antibodies, but not an actin antibody, immunoprecipitated the A3G promoter in A3.01\u2009T cells (Figure 6C, upper panel). In contrast, no PCR signal was received with a primer pair recognizing a region in the A3G gene \u223c4000\u2009bp downstream of the Sp1/Sp3\u2013binding site (Figure 6C, lower panel). Only the positive controls showed a DNA band, with an A3G expression plasmid or the sheared and cross-linked input DNA used as template. This demonstrates the binding of Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors to the endogenous A3G promoter.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":3},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":8,"end":11},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":34,"end":38},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":34,"end":38},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":46,"end":52},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":80,"end":83},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":120,"end":126},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":127,"end":152},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":127,"end":152},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":183,"end":186},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":191,"end":194},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":365,"end":368},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":615,"end":625},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":629,"end":632},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1494,"end":1497},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1503,"end":1506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1653,"end":1656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1751,"end":1754},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1839,"end":1845},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1861,"end":1864},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1879,"end":1903},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1879,"end":1903},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1908,"end":1911},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1916,"end":1919},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1929,"end":1936},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1929,"end":1936},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1940,"end":1943},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1948,"end":1951},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1998,"end":2001},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2002,"end":2010},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":2072,"end":2075},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":2080,"end":2083},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":2107,"end":2112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":2146,"end":2149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":2289,"end":2292},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":2426,"end":2429},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":2430,"end":2440},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":2531,"end":2538},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":2531,"end":2538},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":2542,"end":2545},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":2550,"end":2553},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":2594,"end":2597},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":2598,"end":2606},"obj":"Entity"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T32","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"partOf","subj":"T32","obj":"T12"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T32","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T35","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R19","pred":"partOf","subj":"T35","obj":"T17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T28","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T35","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T38","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R25","pred":"partOf","subj":"T38","obj":"T26"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T25","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T38","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R3","pred":"partOf","subj":"T28","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T28","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T29","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"partOf","subj":"T29","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T29","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
