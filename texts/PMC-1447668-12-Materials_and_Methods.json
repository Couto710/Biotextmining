Ziegler (Benaroya Research Institute). pEGFP-C2 was provided by I. Lipinski (NIDDK/NIH). pcDNA3 was provided by K. T. Jeang (NIAID/NIH). pCMV4-Tax was a generous gift from W. Greene (University of California San Francisco). pGL4-luc2 and pGL4-TKhRluc2 were purchased from Promega (Madison, Wisconsin, United States). pUC18 was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, California, United States). HIV-1 wt LTR and HIV-1 \u0394-\u03baB LTR luciferase reporter vectors were constructed by cloning the XhoI/HindIII LTR fragments from pHIV-CAT and p\u0394-\u03baB-HIV-CAT (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, NIAID/NIH) into the multiple cloning site of pGL4-luc2. NF-\u03baB, HTLV-I LTR, and CREB luciferase reporter and pCMV-p300-HA expression vectors were generously provided by B. Wigdahl (Drexel University College of Medicine). HTLV-I pACH infectious molecular clone has been described previously [30]. pFR-luc, pFA-CMV, pFA2-CREB-1, and pFA2-c-Jun were purchased from Stratagene. pFA-Tax (encoding a fusion protein consisting of the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused in-frame to HTLV-I Tax) was constructed by PCR amplification of HTLV-I Tax using pCMV4-Tax as a template and BamHI/BglII-tagged primers. The amplified insert was digested and ligated into the BamHI/BglII sites of pFA-CMV. Plasmid contents were confirmed by DNA sequencing.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":10,"end":20},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":10,"end":20},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":49},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":56,"end":61},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":83,"end":88},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":89,"end":96},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":101,"end":122},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":316,"end":319},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":597,"end":607},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":694,"end":697},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":712,"end":715},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":846,"end":856},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":875,"end":879},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":883,"end":893},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":883,"end":893},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1080,"end":1086},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1097,"end":1102},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1142},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1188,"end":1192},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1240},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1289,"end":1292},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1305,"end":1308},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"partOf","subj":"T19","obj":"T3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
