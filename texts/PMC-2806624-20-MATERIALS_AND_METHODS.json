Cells were lysed by sonication in HKMG buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). The cell lysate was precleared using streptavidin-agarose beads (GE Healthcare), incubated with biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the wild-type or mutated RUNX binding sites, and polydeoxyinosinicdeoxycytidylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). A combination of all three oligonucleotides containing the mutated or the wild-type binding sites was used in the assay. DNA-bound proteins were collected with streptavidin-agarose beads, washed with HKMG buffer, and finally resuspended in NuPAGE loading buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), heated to 70\u00b0C for 10 min, and separated on a NuPAGE 4\u201312% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen Life Technologies). The proteins were electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) and detected using RUNX1 or RUNX3 antibodies described in the previous section.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":36,"end":47},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":36,"end":47},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":53,"end":58},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":62,"end":67},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":1103,"end":1108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1117},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
