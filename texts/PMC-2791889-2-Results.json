Culture with high doses of antigen for 7 days gave rise to Th1 cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 upon restimulation (Constant et\u00a0al., 1995; Hosken et\u00a0al., 1995), but not IL-10 (Figure\u00a0S1A available online). Culture with low antigen doses under the same conditions led to the differentiation of Th2 cells, which expressed both IL-4 and IL-10 upon restimulation (Figure\u00a0S1A). Culture of naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells in an APC-free system by stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies in the presence of IL-12 resulted in IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells, a proportion of which coproduced IL-10, as did Th2 cells resulting from culture in IL-4 (Figure\u00a0S1B).\nTo investigate whether the lack of IL-10 produced by Th1 cells resulted from inhibition of IL-10 production by DCs and high antigen dose or alternatively required IL-12, we cultured naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells with increasing doses of antigen presented by DC in the presence of IL-12. At low doses of antigen, IL-12 abrogated the development of Th2 cells and induced IFN-\u03b3 expression but only low levels of IL-10 expression, suggesting that IL-12 per se was not sufficient to induce significant IL-10 production in Th1 cells (Figure\u00a01A). Strikingly, as the antigen dose was increased, Th1 populations driven with IL-12 now contained higher numbers of IL-10-producing cells (Figure\u00a01A) and produced more IL-10 protein upon restimulation (Figures 1A and 1B). Thus, the development of Th1 cells producing IL-10 required both IL-12 and high doses of antigen. Th1 cells differentiated to produce large amounts of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 and lost their\u00a0capacity to produce IL-2 (Figure\u00a01B). Because the presence of IL-12 reduced the proliferation of CD4+ T\u00a0cells at both high and\u00a0low antigen doses (Table S1), and only the former showed IL-10 production, the development of high IL-10-producing cells\u00a0is most likely not related to limited IL-2. Naive CD4+ T\u00a0cells from DO11.10/recombination-activating gene 1 (Rag1)-deficient animals, cultured with high doses of antigen in the presence of IL-12, also resulted in IL-10 expression by Th1 cells, showing that this expression was not dependent on the presence of effector or memory T\u00a0cells or Treg cells (Figure\u00a0S2). Although it has been suggested that TGF-\u03b2 can induce IL-10 in CD4+ T\u00a0cells (Kitani et\u00a0al., 2003; Schiott et\u00a0al., 2000), we found that in developing Th1 and Th2 cells this was not the case (data not shown). In fact, neutralization of TGF-\u03b2 led to increased IL-10 production by both T\u00a0cell subsets (Figure\u00a0S3). Thus, the development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells only depended on the presence of IL-12 together with high antigen dose and not on other soluble factors such as IL-2 or TGF-\u03b2 or on the presence of other T\u00a0cell types.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":68,"end":77},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":78,"end":83},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":126,"end":137},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":126,"end":137},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":138,"end":143},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":148,"end":153},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":205,"end":208},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":268,"end":277},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":295,"end":298},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":352,"end":356},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":352,"end":356},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":370,"end":380},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":370,"end":380},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":381,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":460,"end":465},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":601,"end":610},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":601,"end":610},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":616,"end":620},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":625,"end":630},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":681,"end":684},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":741,"end":744},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":754,"end":758},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":789,"end":794},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":795,"end":803},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":795,"end":803},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":807,"end":812},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":813,"end":822},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":856,"end":866},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":867,"end":872},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":917,"end":921},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":963,"end":967},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":971,"end":976},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":977,"end":985},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":999,"end":1007},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1023},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1027,"end":1032},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1043},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1104},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1124,"end":1127},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1205,"end":1210},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1242},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1286,"end":1293},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1286,"end":1293},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1294,"end":1299},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1300,"end":1310},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1334,"end":1339},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1340,"end":1350},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1368,"end":1373},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1403,"end":1409},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1422,"end":1427},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1428,"end":1438},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1540,"end":1545},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1578,"end":1583},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1584,"end":1593},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1616,"end":1624},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1625,"end":1629},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1630,"end":1635},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1719,"end":1728},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1729,"end":1734},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":1735,"end":1743},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1749,"end":1754},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E30","span":{"begin":1810,"end":1817},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E31","span":{"begin":1810,"end":1817},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1835,"end":1840},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1845,"end":1850},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E32","span":{"begin":1855,"end":1859},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E33","span":{"begin":1878,"end":1885},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1886,"end":1890},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1928,"end":1933},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1963,"end":1966},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":2050,"end":2055},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E34","span":{"begin":2056,"end":2066},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":2092,"end":2097},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E35","span":{"begin":2098,"end":2107},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E36","span":{"begin":2144,"end":2151},"obj"
