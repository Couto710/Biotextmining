For viral inoculation, mice were anesthetized by i.p. injection with ketamine (12 mg/kg) and xylazine (60 mg/kg) and 50 \u00b5l X-47 diluted in PBS was administered intranasally. For lethal and sublethal infection, mice received respectively 2-LD50 or 0.05-LD50 X-47. To determine pulmonary viral titers, median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) was measured as follows: lungs were homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer (Kinematica) in PBS. Eight-fold serial dilutions of lung homogenates were incubated on MDCK cells for 5 days in DMEM supplemented with trypsin (1 \u00b5g/ml), 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.4 mM sodium pyruvate and antibiotics. For read-out, 0.5% chicken red blood cells (RBC) were added and end-point dilution of hemagglutination was monitored. TCID50 titers were then calculated according to the method of Reed and Muench [85].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins"}
