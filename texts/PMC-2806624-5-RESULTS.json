To target all Runx proteins that might be involved in the induction of Foxp3, we used mice in which loxP-flanked Cbfb alleles were inactivated in T cells through expression of a CD4-cre transgene. Retinoic acid and TGF-\u03b2 synergize in the induction of Foxp3 in naive T cells (Kang et al., 2007). To investigate whether Runx-mediated induction of Foxp3 is dependent on the expression of CBF\u03b2, naive CD4+ CD8\u2212 T cells from CbfbF/F CD4-cre and control CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice were stimulated with anti-CD3/28 mAbs, retinoic acid, and increasing concentrations of TGF-\u03b2. After 3 d in culture, the cells were restimulated with PMA and ionomycin and analyzed for intracellular Foxp3 and IFN-\u03b3 expression. TGF-\u03b2 induced Foxp3 in CbfbF/+ CD4-cre cells in a dose dependent manner, and this was significantly reduced in CbfbF/F CD4-cre cells. Retinoic acid enhanced Foxp3 expression even in 20 pg/ml of TGF-\u03b2 and more than 95% of the CD4+ T cells from CbfbF/+ CD4-cre mice became Foxp3+ in 100 and 500 pg/ml TGF-\u03b2 doses. The induction of Foxp3 was again significantly lower in CbfbF/F CD4-cre CD4+ T cells even in the presence of retinoic acid, demonstrating that deficiency in Runx binding to DNA affects the TGF-\u03b2 induction of Foxp3 in T reg cells (Fig. 5 A). There was no difference in the induction of Foxp3 when endogenous IL-4 and IFN-\u03b3 were neutralized (Fig. S6).\nThe importance of RUNX transcription factors for the in vivo conversion of naive CD4+ T cells into iT reg cells was examined. Control CbfbF/F or CbfbF/F CD4-cre naive T cells, harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele were adoptively transferred into Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice. 6 wk later, CD4+ T cells in spleen, mesenteric lymph node, and lamina propria of the small intestine were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression (Fig. 5 B). There was a consistently lower percentage of CD4+ T cells that had developed Foxp3 expression in the mesenteric lymph node and lamina propria of mice transferred with CbfbF/F CD4-cre cells compared with control cells (Fig. 5, B and C). These data affirm the significance of RUNX proteins for the in vivo generation of CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":8,"end":12},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":20,"end":29},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":33,"end":38},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":39,"end":43},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":70,"end":74},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":180,"end":184},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":208,"end":216},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":224,"end":233},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":237,"end":242},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":279,"end":283},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":297,"end":308},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":328,"end":338},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":344,"end":351},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":381,"end":386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":387,"end":396},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":404,"end":413},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":417,"end":422},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":484,"end":488},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":489,"end":497},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":498,"end":507},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":511,"end":516},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":520,"end":529},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":537,"end":547},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":551,"end":555},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":563,"end":566},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":568,"end":571},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":586,"end":590},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":594,"end":601},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":614,"end":618},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":622,"end":629},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":661,"end":664},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":665,"end":667},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":722,"end":727},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":833,"end":838},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":843,"end":848},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":849,"end":859},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":849,"end":859},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":861,"end":866},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":867,"end":874},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":875,"end":880},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":884,"end":888},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":892,"end":899},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":961,"end":968},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":972,"end":976},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":980,"end":987},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1009,"end":1017},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1018,"end":1023},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1024,"end":1034},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":1055,"end":1060},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":1086,"end":1089},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":1104,"end":1108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1119},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":1132,"end":1137},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":1160,"end":1165},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1177,"end":1186},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T38","span":{"begin":1190,"end":1195},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1220,"end":1225},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T39","span":{"begin":1229,"end":1233},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T40","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1244},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1248},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":1330,"end":1334},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1335,"end":1342},"obj":"Binding"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1350,"end":1357},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":1362,"end":1367},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1368,"end":1377},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T44","span":{"begin":1381,"end":1386},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":1427,"end":1437},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1427,"end":1437},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1445,"end":1454},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T45","span":{"begin":1458,"end":1463},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T46","span":{"begin":1480,"end":1484},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T47","span":{"begin":1489,"end":1494},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":1500,"end":1511},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1500,"end":1511},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T48","span":{"begin":1541,"end":1545},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T49","span":{"begin":1604,"end":1607},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T50","span":{"begin":1657,"end":1
