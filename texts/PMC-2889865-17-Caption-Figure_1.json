Jurkat T-cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids containing the AP-1 cis-elements. (A) Time-dependent AP-1 activation in response to PMA. (B) HK E. coli does not activate AP-1. (C) Dose-dependent activation of AP-1 were performed using PMA alone (grey bars) and in combination with calcium ionophore (CaI 955 \u03bcM, black bars). (D) TCR-/- deficient cells responded to PMA (162 nM) by up-regulating AP-1 activity. Statistical significance from the control was determined using Student's t-test. (n = 4). Controls were arbitrarily set to 1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":108,"end":118},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
