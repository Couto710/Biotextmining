P. aeruginosa strains PAO1 and PAO1\u0394exsA were grown from overnight cultures in Luria Bertani (LB) broth and LB+streptomycin (150 \u00b5g/ml) until mid-logarithmic phase. Cells were washed once in PBS and resuspended in PBS to an optical density of 0.5 (\u03bb\u200a=\u200a600 nm). To prepare heat-killed bacteria, live PAO1 was resuspended in PBS to an optical density of 0.5 and heated at 60\u00b0C for 1 hour. For stimulations, live PAO1 was resuspended to an optical density of 0.5 in PBS and further diluted in culture medium prior to stimulation to achieve the desired multiplicity of infection. Heat-killed PAO1 was added in a volume equivalent to that used to achieve an MOI of 1 for live PAO1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
