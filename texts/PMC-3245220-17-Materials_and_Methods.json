Briefly, monocytes were resuspended in Amaxa Nucleofactor solution at a density of 20\u00d7106 cells/ml, and 2 \u00b5g of total plasmid DNA 100 nM of PKC\u03b1 siRNA or control siRNA was added and transfected using program Amaxa Y-01. For co-transfection studies, PKC\u03b1 or NF-\u03baB p65 constructs were mixed at a ratio of 5\u22361 with the reporter plasmid. Immediately after transfection, cells were washed with 1 ml of RPMI medium containing 2 mM glutamine and 10% FBS or serum free LGM medium (Lonza Walkersville Inc.) then plated at 4\u00d7105 cells/well in 24-well plates. The original medium was replaced by serum free LGM medium without or with M-CSF (100 ng/ml) one hour later. The next day, cell-free supernatants were collected for the SEAP analysis. Cells were stained with Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI). For the inhibition studies, cells were pre-incubated with inhibitor for 30 minutes in X-vivo medium prior to the addition of M-CSF.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":338,"end":348},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":447,"end":451},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":461,"end":464},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":821,"end":826},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":954,"end":963},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1112,"end":1117},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
