GATA3 forward primer, 5\u2032-GCGGGCTCTATCACAAAATGA-3\u2032; and GATA3 reverse primer 5\u2032-GCTCTCCTGGCTGCAGACAGC-3\u2032 (Mantel et al., 2007). T-bet forward primer, 5\u2032-GATGCGCCAGGAAGTTTCAT-3\u2032; T-bet reverse primer, 5\u2032-GCACAATCATCTGGGTCACATT-3\u2032; RORC2 forward primer, 5\u2032-CAGTCATGAGAACACAAATTGAAGTG-3\u2032; and RORC2 reverse primer 5\u2032-CAGGTGATAACCCCGTAGTGGAT-3\u2032. The prepared cDNAs were amplified using SYBR green PCR master mix (Fermentas) according to the recommendations of the manufacturer in an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems).\nRUNX1 and RUNX3 mRNA was detected by using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays from Applied Biosystems and used according to the manufacturer's instruction using TaqMan master mix using a 7000 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). PCR amplification of the housekeeping gene encoding elongation factor (EF)-1\u03b1 or by using the 18S rRNA Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems) was performed to allow normalization between samples. Relative quantification and calculation of the range of confidence was performed using the comparative \u0394\u0394CT method (Applied Biosystems). The percentage of FOXP3 mRNA in siRNA-mediated RUNX knockdown cells was calculated in relation to cells, which were transfected with scrambled control siRNA. Arbitrary units show the 2\u2212(\u0394ct) values multiplied by 10,000 incorporating the ct values of the gene of interest and the housekeeping gene.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":173,"end":178},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":226,"end":231},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":273,"end":278},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":327,"end":332},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":422,"end":427},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":477,"end":482},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":549,"end":554},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":599,"end":604},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":651,"end":656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":711,"end":716},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":963,"end":968},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":973,"end":978},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":979,"end":983},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":979,"end":983},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1245,"end":1270},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1287,"end":1295},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1548,"end":1553},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":1554,"end":1558},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":1568,"end":1576},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1577,"end":1581},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1582,"end":1591},"obj":"Negative_regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
