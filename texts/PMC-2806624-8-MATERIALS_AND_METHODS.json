Cd45.1 and Rag2\u2212/\u2212 mice were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and Taconic, respectively. For the in vivo Foxp3 conversion assay, naive CD4+ T cells from Cbfb CD4-cre or control mice (harboring a Foxp3-IRES-GFP allele) were adoptively transferred into Rag-deficient mice. 5 \u00d7 106 cells were used per transfer. 6 wk later, TCR\u03b2+CD4+ gated cells from the spleen, mesenteric lymph node (MLN), and lamina propria of the small intestine were analyzed for Foxp3-GFP expression. All analyses and experiments were performed on animals at 6\u20138 wk of age. Animals were housed under specific pathogen\u2013free conditions at the animal facility of the Skirball Institute, and experiments were performed in accordance with approved protocols for the New York University Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":6,"end":10},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":17},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":18,"end":21},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":26,"end":31},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":31,"end":34},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":115,"end":121},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":126,"end":130},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":238,"end":243},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":268,"end":271},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":286,"end":290},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":291,"end":294},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":295,"end":298},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":328,"end":333},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":339,"end":342},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":384,"end":387},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":388,"end":397},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":454,"end":458},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":459,"end":462},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":582,"end":591},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":592,"end":602},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
