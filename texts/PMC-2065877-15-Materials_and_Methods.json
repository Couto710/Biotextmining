The mCK-1 probe template set (BD Biosciences) was labeled using the In Vitro Transcription Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Briefly, 50 ng of mCK-1 probe set was labeled with [\u03b1-32P]UTP using T7 RNA polymerase and purified using Sephadex G-50 columns (NucAway Spin column, Ambion). The labeled probe was quantitated using a scintillation counter, and 6 \u00d7 105 cherenkov cpm was used to hybridize to 4 \u03bcg of total RNA using the RPA kit (BD Biosciences). Samples were denatured at 90 \u00b0C and hybridized at 56 \u00b0C overnight. Single-stranded RNA was digested with a mixture of Rnase A and T1, and precipitated using isopropanol. Protected probes were resolved on a denaturing 4.75% acrylamide gel, dried, and imaged using a phosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Densitometry was performed using the ImageQuant TL v2005 software (GE Healthcare).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":52,"end":56},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":800,"end":807},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":812,"end":814},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
