Shown are the results from WT lymphoma 1 and LMP1 transgenic lymphoma 4. This analysis was repeated on four other LMP1 transgenic lymphomas (1, 2, 3, and 6) showing a similar B-1a phenotype, of which lymphomas 2 and 4 were also doubly positive for \u03ba and \u03bb light chains.\n(B) Flow cytometry analysis of WT or LMP1 transgenic splenocytes for B-1a (CD19+CD5+) and B-1b or B2 subsets (CD19+CD5\u2212). Percentages of B-1a and B-1b or B2 subsets are shown in each quadrant. This analysis was repeated on three other WT and two other LMP1 transgenic mice with similar results.\n(C) Immunoblot analysis for \u03ba and \u03bb light chains of B cells (CD19+) purified from WT and LMP1 transgenic mice. Actin was used as a loading control.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":119,"end":123},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":164,"end":168},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":182,"end":185},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":301,"end":305},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":370,"end":374},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":563,"end":567},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":601,"end":605},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":606,"end":609},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":636,"end":640},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":641,"end":644},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":778,"end":782},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":882,"end":886},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":910,"end":914},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
