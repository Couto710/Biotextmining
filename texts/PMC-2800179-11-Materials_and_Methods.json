Cells were then pelleted, washed and homogenised in lysis buffer (10 mM Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.6% NP-40, and 0.5 mM PMSF) on ice. Homogenates were sonicated, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to remove cellular debris, and supernatant collected. Protein concentration was determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins in samples (15 \u00b5g total proteins) were resolved in a denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. I-\u03baB\u03b1 protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA) followed by a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat polyclonal antibody against rabbit Ig (Caltag Laboratories). Finally, I\u03baB bands were revealed using the ECL\u2122 detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Les Ullis, France) according to the manufacturers' instruction. Antibody to \u03b1-Tubulin (Santa Cruz) was use as loading control.\nFor nuclear NF-\u03baB, THP-1 cells were stimulated with 1 mg/ml C10 or C40 for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. Cells were then pelleted and nuclei separated as described [31]. Nuclei were washed and homogenized directly in loading (Laemli) buffer and heated for 5 minutes at 100\u00b0C. Proteins in samples were resolved in a denaturing 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a polyvinylidine fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were incubated in blocking buffer (1% BSA, in PBS) for two hours at room temperature. Membranes were subsequently probed with the corresponding antibody in blocking buffer, overnight. Rabbit polyclonal antibody anti-NF-\u03baB p50 subunit (# sc-114) or anti-NF-\u03baB p65 subunit (# sc-109) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used. Membranes were washed six times in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, 5 minutes each time, and incubated with a 1/3000 dilution of HRP-conjugated F(ab')2 goat anti-rabbit IgG in 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature. After washing six more times in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, antibody-reactive proteins were detected using a chemiluminescence substrate (SuperSignal; Pierce, Rockford, IL) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To confirm that equivalent amounts of protein were loaded in each line, membranes were also Western blotted for ERK as described [32].","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":595,"end":600},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
