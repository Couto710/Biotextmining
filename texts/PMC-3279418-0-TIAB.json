The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this inflammatory phenotype remain elusive. Dendritic cells may contribute to the initiation and progression of the phenotype of SHARPIN-deficient mice because of their pivotal role in innate and adaptive immunity. Here we show by flow cytometry that SHARPIN- deficiency did not alter the distribution of different DC subtypes in the spleen. In response to TOLL-like receptor (TLR) agonists LPS and poly I:C, cultured bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from WT and mutant mice exhibited similar increases in expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86. However, stimulated SHARPIN-deficient BMDC had reduced transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators IL6, IL12P70, GMCSF, and nitric oxide. Mutant BMDC had defective activation of NF-\u03baB signaling, whereas the MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) and MAPK11/12/13/14 (p38 MAP kinase isoforms) and TBK1 signaling pathways were intact. A mixed lymphocyte reaction showed that mutant BMDC only induced a weak Th1 immune response but stimulated increased Th2 cytokine production from allogeneic na\u00efve CD4+ T cells. In conclusion, loss of Sharpin in mice significantly affects the immune function of DC and this may partially account for the systemic inflammation and Th2-biased immune response.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":7},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":131,"end":140},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":148,"end":155},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":157,"end":203},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":220,"end":226},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":228,"end":233},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":581,"end":588},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":589,"end":598},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":703,"end":710},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":712,"end":722},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1007,"end":1011},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1013,"end":1017},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1023,"end":1027},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1049,"end":1056},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":1057,"end":1066},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1083},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1083},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1083},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1076,"end":1083},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1097},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1097},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1102,"end":1111},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1102,"end":1111},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1142,"end":1145},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1156,"end":1161},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1250,"end":1255},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1256,"end":1257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1263},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1264,"end":1265},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1271,"end":1277},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1278,"end":1280},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1281,"end":1283},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1284,"end":1286},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1317,"end":1321},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1546,"end":1550},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1554,"end":1561},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T3","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R14","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R17","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R2","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T5","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R20","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R3","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T4","obj":"T2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T16","obj":"T14"},{"id":"R5","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T17","obj":"T15"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E4"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
