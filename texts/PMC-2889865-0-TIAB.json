Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF, IL-6 and CXCL8 are associated with several human diseases including cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis and AIDS. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the transcription factors, AP-1 and NF-\u03baB, in IL-6 and CXCL8 regulation in Jurkat T-cells.\nResults\nPhorbol myristate acetate (PMA) exposure resulted in an up-regulation of AP-1 and down-regulation of NF-\u03baB activity, however, exposure to heat killed (HK) Escherichia. coli MG1655 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in NF-\u03baB activity without affecting AP-1. The cytokine profile revealed an up-regulation of the chemokine CXCL8 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-2 and IL-6 following treatment with both PMA and HK E. coli, while the levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were not affected by PMA but were significantly down-regulated by HK E. coli. AP-1 activation was significantly increased 2 h after PMA exposure and continued to increase thereafter. In contrast, NF-\u03baB responded to PMA exposure by a rapid up-regulation followed by a subsequent down-regulation. Increased intracellular Ca2+ concentrations countered the down-regulation of NF-\u03baB by PMA, while similar treatment with calcium ionophore resulted in a reduced NF-\u03baB activity following induction with HK E. coli. In order to further study NF-\u03baB activation, we considered two up-stream signalling proteins, PKC and Bcl10. Phosphorylated-PKC levels increased in response to PMA and HK E. coli, while Bcl10 levels significantly decreased following PMA treatment. Using an NF-\u03baB activation inhibitor, we observed complete inhibition of IL-6 expression while CXCL8 levels only decreased by 40% at the highest concentration. Treatment of Jurkat T-cells with PMA in the presence of JNK-inhibitor suppressed both CXCL8 and IL-6 while PKC-inhibitor primarily decreased CXCL8 expression.\nConclusion\nThe present study shows that NF-\u03baB regulated IL-6 but not CXCL8. This complex regulation of CXCL8 suggests that there is a need to further evaluate the signalling pathways in order to develop new treatment for diseases with elevated CXCL8 levels, such as AIDS and autoimmune diseases.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":333,"end":337},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":342,"end":347},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":492,"end":496},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":492,"end":496},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":546,"end":550},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":555,"end":560},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":561,"end":571},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":561,"end":571},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":892,"end":905},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":892,"end":905},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":892,"end":905},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":923,"end":928},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":969,"end":973},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":978,"end":982},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1084,"end":1089},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1099,"end":1107},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":1138,"end":1152},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1698,"end":1703},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1782,"end":1787},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1809,"end":1818},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1902,"end":1912},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1916,"end":1920},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1921,"end":1931},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1938,"end":1943},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1956,"end":1965},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":2073,"end":2083},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":2073,"end":2083},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2089,"end":2094},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":2099,"end":2103},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":2134,"end":2143},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":2144,"end":2149},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":2150,"end":2160},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":2208,"end":2217},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":2208,"end":2217},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":2218,"end":2222},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":2231,"end":2236},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":2251,"end":2261},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":2265,"end":2270},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":2397,"end":2405},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":2406,"end":2411},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E8"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E18"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Negation","obj":"E19"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
