A mouse IgG1 antibody (BioLegend) was used as an isotype control. Data were analyzed with the CXP software (Beckman Coulter). Cells were cultured with IL-2, and then left unstimulated or stimulated with anti-CD2/-CD3/-CD28 mAb.\nFlow cytometry analyses of the mouse cells were performed on an LSRII (BD) and cell sorting was performed on a FACSAria (BD). All antibodies for these experiments were purchased from eBioscience or BD.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":38,"end":43},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":44,"end":54},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":126,"end":129},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":230,"end":235},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":523,"end":527},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":580,"end":583},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":585,"end":588},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":590,"end":594},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
