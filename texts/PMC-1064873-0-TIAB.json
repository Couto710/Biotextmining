We found that peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were able to produce greater amounts of interferon gamma after CD3 and CD28 costimulation in the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10 than were normal control CD4+ T cells, although their surface expression of the type 1 IL-10 receptor was increased. The phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 was sustained in both blood and synovial tissue CD4+ T cells of RA, but it was not augmented by the presence of 1 ng/ml IL-10. Sera from RA patients induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation in normal CD4+ T cells, which was mostly abolished by neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody. Preincubation of normal CD4+ T cells with IL-6 reduced IL-10-mediated inhibition of interferon gamma production. Blood CD4+ T cells from RA patients contained higher levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 but lower levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA compared with control CD4+ T cells, as determined by real-time PCR. These results indicate that RA CD4+ T cells become resistant to the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10 before migration into synovial tissue, and this impaired IL-10 signaling may be associated with sustained signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation and suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 induction.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-test-proteins","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":34,"end":50},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":80,"end":114},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":118,"end":121},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":170,"end":175},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":264,"end":268},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":319,"end":322},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":424,"end":440},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":455,"end":459},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":501,"end":506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":532,"end":535},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":587,"end":608},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":647,"end":697},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":746,"end":749},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":818,"end":823},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":855,"end":905},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":932,"end":935},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":994,"end":998},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1033,"end":1036},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1051,"end":1055},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1064,"end":1069},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1093,"end":1109},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1128,"end":1131},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1185,"end":1219},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1240,"end":1274},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1302,"end":1305},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1379,"end":1382},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1444,"end":1449},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":1507,"end":1512},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":1556,"end":1606},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":1622,"end":1656},"obj":"Protein"}]}
