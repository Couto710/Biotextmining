The purity of CD4+ T cells was initially tested by flow cytometry and was \u226595%. Cells were stimulated with the following combination of mAbs to T cell surface molecules (Meiler et al., 2008): anti-CD2 (clone 4B2 and 6G4; 0.5 \u00b5g/ml), anti-CD3 (clone OKT3; 0.5 \u00b5g/ml), and anti-CD28 mAb (clone B7G5; 0.5 \u00b5g/ml; all from Sanquin) and cultured in serum-free AIM-V medium (Life Technologies) with the addition of 1 nmol/liter IL-2 (Roche). TGF-\u03b2 (R\u0026D Systems) was used at 5 ng/ml, if not stated otherwise. A combination of PMA (25 ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was used.\nHuman CD4+ CD127\u2212 CD25high and CD4+ CD127+ CD25neg cells were purified by flow cytometry using anti-CD127, anti\u2013CD25-PC5 (Beckman Coulter), and anti\u2013CD4-FITC antibodies (Dako).\nMouse naive (CD62Lhi44lo25\u2212) CD4+ T cells were purified by flow cytometry and activated in vitro with 5 \u00b5g/ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1 \u00b5g/ml soluble anti-CD28 antibodies (eBioscience) in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 5 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, and antibiotics. Neutralizing anti\u2013IFN-\u03b3 and anti\u2013IL-4 mAbs (BD) were used at 1 \u00b5g/ml concentrations when indicated.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":20,"end":23},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":141,"end":144},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":189,"end":192},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":204,"end":207},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":281,"end":284},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":464,"end":467},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":505,"end":508},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":543,"end":547},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":688,"end":692},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":702,"end":707},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":855,"end":858},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":860,"end":865},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":867,"end":871},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":880,"end":883},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":885,"end":890},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":892,"end":896},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":949,"end":954},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":961,"end":965},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":998,"end":1001},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1039,"end":1044},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1046,"end":1048},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1050,"end":1052},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1055,"end":1058},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1153,"end":1156},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1182,"end":1186},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1306,"end":1311},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1321,"end":1325},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
