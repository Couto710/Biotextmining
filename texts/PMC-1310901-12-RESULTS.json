This technique is especially useful for detection of unknown methylation patterns. PCR amplification, cloning and sequencing of the bisulfite-treated DNA showed a specific methylation pattern of the analyzed 62 CpG sites in all cell lines (Figure 4 and Table 1). In general, the methylational status ranged from one cell line with a nearly non-methylated IRF-4 promoter (SD-1, IRF-4-positive) to a completely methylated IRF-4 promoter in CML-T1 (IRF-4-negative). Interestingly, the percentage of CpG methylation in the IRF-4 promoter from IRF-4-positive cells was very low (mean 24%) as compared with IRF-4-negative cells (mean 94%) (Figure 4A and Table 1). A 5\u2032-region (R1) with 13 hypermethylated CpG sites (mean number of methylated clones 5.5 of 8 with 77% methylated CpGs) was found in most cells (except SD-1 and RPMI-8226) and a 3\u2032-region (R3) of 6 hypomethylated CpG sites (mean number of methylated clones 1.7 of 8 with 33% methylated CpGs) was found in most cells (except CML-T1 and U-937) (Figure 4A and Table 1).\nIntriguingly, a stretch of 13 CpG sites (#10\u201322; R2) was detected in between these regions, which were highly methylated in IRF-4-negative (mean number of methylated clones 7.1 of 8 with 89% methylated CpGs) but totally non-methylated in IRF-4-positive cells (Figure 4A and B). Furthermore, three CpG sites at the 5\u2032 end (#54, 56, 58) and two CpG motifs at the 3\u2032 end (#1, 2) showed this direct correlation between high methylation status and absence of IRF-4 expression. In addition, two CpG sites located in a NF\u03baB (#48) and a SP1 element (#45) are less methylated in IRF-4-positive than in IRF-4-negative cells (mean number of methylated clones: 1/8 versus 8/8). These results indicate the involvement of CpG methylation in the regulation of IRF-4 expression in leukemic cells.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":26,"end":31},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":136,"end":141},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":766,"end":771},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":788,"end":793},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":794,"end":802},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":831,"end":836},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":857,"end":862},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":863,"end":871},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":930,"end":935},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":950,"end":955},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":956,"end":964},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1012,"end":1017},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":1018,"end":1026},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1560,"end":1565},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":1566,"end":1574},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1674,"end":1679},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":1680,"end":1688},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":1879,"end":1886},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1890,"end":1895},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":1896,"end":1906},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":2006,"end":2011},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":2012,"end":2020},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":2029,"end":2034},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":2035,"end":2043},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":2167,"end":2177},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":2181,"end":2186},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":2187,"end":2197},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Negation","obj":"E5"},{"id":"M4","pred":"Negation","obj":"E10"},{"id":"M5","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E11"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
