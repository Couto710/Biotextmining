Statistical analysis was performed using the Dunnett test. Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks (*p \u2264 0.05, **p \u2264 0.01, Dunnett).\n(B) CD4+CD45RA+ cells were activated in the presence of a constant concentration of TGF-\u03b2 (5 ng/ml) with an increasing concentration of IL-4, as indicated. Cells were harvested for mRNA quantification after 5 d.\n(C) CD4+CD45RA+ cells were stimulated in vitro with plate-bound anti-CD3/CD28, TGF-\u03b2 (10ng/ml), and IL-4 (100 ng/ml) as indicated. After 1 h, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot for phosphorylated SMAD2 and STAT6. Total STAT6 and GAPDH served as internal control.\n(D) Intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining are shown after exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to IL-4 as described for panel B. Data are representative of three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":6},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":10,"end":14},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":18,"end":23},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":24,"end":33},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":101,"end":106},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":138,"end":142},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":371,"end":374},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":375,"end":381},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":451,"end":456},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":475,"end":485},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":503,"end":507},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":583,"end":586},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":587,"end":593},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":648,"end":651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":652,"end":656},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":658,"end":663},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":679,"end":683},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":781,"end":795},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":781,"end":795},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":796,"end":801},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":806,"end":811},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":819,"end":824},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":829,"end":834},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":881,"end":886},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":891,"end":896},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":897,"end":905},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":897,"end":905},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":934,"end":937},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":938,"end":944},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":957,"end":961},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E7"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E4"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
