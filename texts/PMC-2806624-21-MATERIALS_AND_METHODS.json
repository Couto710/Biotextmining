Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. 384-well plates, precoated with streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were washed 3 times with washing buffer (PBS and 0.05% Tween 20). Biotinylated FOXP3 promoter/oligonucleotides probes containing the RUNX binding sites were added (1 pmol per well; 50 fmol/\u00b5l) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Either a combination of all three oligonucleotides containing the mutated or the wild-type binding sites was used or single oligonucleotides were used in the assay. After 3 washing steps with washing buffer, the nuclear extract was added (concentration \u003E 0.2 \u00b5g/\u00b5l) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. The lysates were incubated with 10 \u00b5g of poly-deoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid (Sigma-Aldrich). The plate was washed with HKMG buffer and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX1 (ab11903, Abcam) or 1:200 dilution of rabbit anti-RUNX3 (H-50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. After three washing steps with HKMG buffer, a secondary antibody (anti\u2013rabbit IgG-HRP, 1:3,000 in HKMG buffer, Cell Signaling Technology) was added, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. The wells were washed 4 times with HKMG buffer before adding the substrate reagent (R\u0026D Systems). The colorimetric reaction was stopped by adding 2 M H2SO4. Absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Berthold Technologies).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":67,"end":80},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":86,"end":97},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":86,"end":97},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":103,"end":108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":112,"end":117},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":343,"end":348},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":985,"end":990},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1041,"end":1046},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
