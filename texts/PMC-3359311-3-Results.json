There was no significant increase upon stimulation with live PAO1 or LPS+ATP at the times examined (Fig. 3a\u2013b). Because previous studies have indicated a role for caspase-1 in the activation of NF-\u03baB through Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling [35], we examined whether chemical inhibition of caspase-1 altered NF-\u03baB-dependent IL-6 production in response to P. aeruginosa. However, treatment with the caspase-1 inhibitor z-YVAD-fmk (YVAD) did not decrease IL-6 secretion by airway epithelial cells (Fig. 3c).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":538,"end":545},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":552,"end":561},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":562,"end":566},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":567,"end":577},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":578,"end":592},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":682,"end":690},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":691,"end":695},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":696,"end":705},"obj":"Localization"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E6"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
