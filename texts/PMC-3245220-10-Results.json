To confirm the role of PKC and p65 Ser276 phosphorylation on NF-\u03baB activity, we co-transfected the NF-\u03baB-SEAP construct with either WT NF-\u03baB p65 or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A constructs in Raw 264.7 cells, then treated cells with the PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 in the absence or presences of M-CSF. As expected in cells transfected with vector control, inhibiting PKC reduced M-CSF-stimulated NF-\u03baB activity compared to cells treated with M-CSF and the vehicle DMSO (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) (Figure 8A). In contrast, expressing WT NF-\u03baB p65 (p65 WT) increased NF-\u03baB activity, while the general PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 decreased this NF-\u03baB activity (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). Notably, the introduction of NF-\u03baB p65 276 S/A construct significantly reduced NF-\u03baB activity compared with the WT NF-\u03baB p65 construct (p\u200a=\u200a0.005) and M-CSF treatment was unable to overcome this inhibition.\nFurthermore, we co-transfected the NF-\u03baB-SEAP construct along with either the WT NF-\u03baB p65, NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A or NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A constructs into a NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 murine fibroblast cell line and measured NF-\u03baB activity. As predicted, expression of WT NF-\u03baB p65 (p65 WT) in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cell line constitutively activated NF-\u03baB compared to cells transfected with vector control without any stimulation (Figure 8B). In comparison, transfecting the NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A construct reduced NF-\u03baB activity by 5-fold (p\u200a=\u200a0.006, WT NF-\u03baB p65 vs. NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A), while expressing the NF-\u03baB p65 536S/A construct increased NF-\u03baB activity in the p65\u2212/\u2212 cells to levels similar to WT NF-\u03baB p65 transfected cells.\nSince M-CSF-induced PKC activation regulated NF-\u03baB activity via Ser276 residue of NF-\u03baB p65 in primary human MDMs and RAW 264.7 cells, we next examined if this occurred in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts in response to a native stimulus for these cells, TNF\u03b1. NF-\u03baB activity was measured in the WT NF-\u03baB p65 or NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A transfected cells treated with TNF\u03b1 in the absence or presence of Ro-31-8220 (Figure 8C). As expected, TNF\u03b1 increased NF-\u03baB activity in NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cells expressing WT p65 and (p\u200a=\u200a0.001) PKC inhibitors decreased NF-\u03baB activity to the non-stimulated (NS) level (p\u200a=\u200a0.007). Introducing NF-\u03baB p65 276 S/A constructs significantly reduced NF-\u03baB activity compared with the WT NF-\u03baB p65 construct (p\u200a=\u200a0.001). Notably, TNF\u03b1 failed to increase NF-\u03baB activity in the NF-\u03baB p65\u2212/\u2212 cells expressing NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A constructs. These observations are similar to macrophages overexpressing the NF-\u03baB p65 276S/A (Figure 8A). Our data demonstrate that Ser276 of NF-\u03baB p65 is essential in regulating NF-\u03baB activity and suggests that PKC regulates NF-\u03baB activity by modulating the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB p65 at Ser276 residue.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T67","span":{"begin":46,"end":51},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":75,"end":86},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":75,"end":86},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":93,"end":96},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":97,"end":112},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":97,"end":112},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T41","span":{"begin":116,"end":122},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T42","span":{"begin":131,"end":137},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":170,"end":173},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T43","span":{"begin":174,"end":180},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":181,"end":196},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":219,"end":233},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":219,"end":233},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":280,"end":283},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":293,"end":296},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T73","span":{"begin":395,"end":402},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T74","span":{"begin":406,"end":415},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T68","span":{"begin":419,"end":424},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T69","span":{"begin":503,"end":508},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T70","span":{"begin":566,"end":571},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":631,"end":641},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":651,"end":654},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":656,"end":659},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":789,"end":801},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":811,"end":814},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":897,"end":900},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T71","span":{"begin":927,"end":932},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":999,"end":1013},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":999,"end":1013},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1070,"end":1073},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1081,"end":1084},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1101,"end":1104},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1136,"end":1139},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1142},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1214,"end":1224},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":1237,"end":1240},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":1242,"end":1245},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":1259,"end":1262},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1262,"end":1265},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1409,"end":1421},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":1432,"end":1435},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1507,"end":1510},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1521,"end":1524},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1540,"end":1550},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1561,"end":1564},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1614,"end":1617},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1617,"end":1620},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1657,"end":1660},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1661,"end":1672},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T72","span":{"begin":1686,"end":1691},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1768,"end":1771},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1858,"end":1861},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1861,"end":1864},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1927,"end":1931},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1977,"end":1980},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1990,"end":1993},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":2001,"end":2012},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":2001,"end":2012},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":2032,"end":2036},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":2104,"end":2108},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T29","span":{"begin":2143,"end":2146},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":2146,"end":2149},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":2156,"end":2166},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T30","span":{"begin":2170,"end":2173},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":2276,"end":2287},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T31","span":{"begin":2294,"end":2297},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T32","span":{"begin":2381,"end":2384},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T33","span":{"begin":2417,"end":2421},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T34","span":{"begin":2469,"end":2472},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":2472,"end":2475},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":2482,"end":2492},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T35","span":{"begin":2499,"end":2502},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E27","span":{"begin":2568,"end":2582},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T36","span":{"begin":2593,"end":2596},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T37","span":{"begin":2659,"end":2662},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E28","span":{"begin":2755,"end":2765},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E29","span":{"begin":2770,"end":2785},"obj":"Phospho
