The mechanism by which phosphodiesterase inhibition alters TNF-\u03b1 production in the presence of LPS remains unclear.\nMETHODS\nHuman mononuclear cells were stimulated with LPS (1 \u03bcg/mL), in the presence and absence of Pentoxifylline (PTX; 20 mM), a nonspecific phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Western blotting of phosphorylated cytoplasmic I-\u03baB\u03b1, nuclear factor-\u03baB p65 (NF-\u03baB), and nuclear cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) was performed. DNA binding of NF-\u03baB and CREB was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. TNF-\u03b1 levels were determined in the supernatant of stimulated cells in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).\nRESULTS\nPTX was demonstrated to significantly reduce cytoplasmic I-\u03baB\u03b1 phosphorylation, nuclear p65 phosphorylation, and the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB. In contrast, PTX markedly enhanced the phosphorylation and DNA binding activity of CREB. Cells concomitantly treated with PTX and LPS secreted similar levels of TNF-\u03b1 in the presence and absence Protein kinase A inhibition.\nDISCUSSION\nThe increased level of cAMP that results from phosphodiesterase inhibition affects cytoplasmic and nuclear events, resulting in the attenuation of NF-\u03baB and the activation of CREB transcriptional DNA binding through pathways that are partially Protein kinase A-independent.\nCONCLUSION\nPTX-mediated phosphodiesterase inhibition occurs partially through a Protein kinase A-independent pathway and may serve as a useful tool in the attenuation of LPS-induced inflammation.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":18,"end":28},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":32,"end":37},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":38,"end":48},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":193,"end":199},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":283,"end":310},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":312,"end":317},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":319,"end":329},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":411,"end":421},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":425,"end":430},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":431,"end":440},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":571,"end":577},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":578,"end":583},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":584,"end":594},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":595,"end":613},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":826,"end":840},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":853,"end":858},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":878,"end":881},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1047,"end":1052},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1266,"end":1272},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1266,"end":1272},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1285,"end":1290},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1291,"end":1306},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1316,"end":1319},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1320,"end":1335},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1510,"end":1518},"obj":"Localization"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1537,"end":1542},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1550,"end":1558},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1563,"end":1570},"obj":"Regulation"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Negation","obj":"E17"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
