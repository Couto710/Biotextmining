(B) Eight week-old females of WT and cpdm mice. The mutant mice (above) develop progressive skin inflammation starting at about four weeks. (C) Extramedullary hematopoiesis causes marked enlargement of the spleen of cpdm mice. (D) BMDC were incubated in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml LPS for 4 hours. The mRNA level of Sharpin was measured by qRT-PCR and presented relative to the mRNA expression in non-stimulated WT BMDC. Bars represent the mean \u00b1 s.d. of 3 mice. * P\u003C0.05; ** P\u003C0.001. (E) Fibroblast (NIH3T3) and macrophages (RAW264.7) cells were transfected with the expression plasmid pFLAG-SHARPIN. After 48 hours, cells were fixed and probed with anti-FLAG and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. In both transfected cell lines, FLAG-SHARPIN was found to be cytoplasm-localized.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":33,"end":40},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":259,"end":266},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":620,"end":630},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":634,"end":641},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":911,"end":918},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1087,"end":1094},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1111,"end":1120},"obj":"Entity"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":1121,"end":1130},"obj":"Localization"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"locationOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E2"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
