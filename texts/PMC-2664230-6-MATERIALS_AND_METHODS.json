The NF-\u03baB 3\u2032 biotin end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide used as a probe for the EMSA was a 42-bp double stranded construct (5\u2032-TTGTTACAA-GGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGAGGC \u2013 3\u2032) containing two tandemly repeated NF-\u03baB binding sites (underlined). Specificity was determined by a competition assay with the addition of 200 molar excess of unlabeled double stranded NF-\u03baB oligonucleotide. The CREB 3\u2032 biotin end-labeled DNA oligonucleotide used as a probe for the EMSA was a 23-bp double stranded construct (5\u2032-TTT TCG AGC TCTGACGTCAGA-GC \u2013 3\u2032) containing the CRE consensus sequence (underlined). Specificity was determined by a competition assay with the addition of 200 molar excess of unlabeled double stranded CREB oligonucleotide.\nNuclear extracts (10 \u03bcg) were incubated with 5 nM NF-\u03baB or CREB probe (NF-kB: 1x binding buffer, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.1% NP40, 10% glycerol, and 50 ng/\u03bcl poly dI-dC, CREB: 1x binding buffer, 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.10% NP40, 6% glycerol, 0.1 mg/mL BSA and 50 ng/\u03bcl poly dI-dC) and were then electrophoresed through a 6% DNA retardation gel at 100V for 90 minutes. The gels were electrophoretically transferred at 380mA for 1 hour on ice to a positively charged nylon membrane and immediately cross-linked for 15 minutes with a UV transilluminator equipped with a 312 nm bulb. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and the LightShift Chemiluminescent Substrate were used to detect the biotin end-labeled DNA. The nylon membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 1\u20133 minutes for detection.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
