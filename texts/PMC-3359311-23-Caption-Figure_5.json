P. aeruginosa lacking exsA was used as a type III secretion control in comparison with wild-type P. aeruginosa. Supernatants were assayed for (A) IL-1\u03b2 and (B) IL-8.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":30,"end":37},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":38,"end":47},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":59,"end":64},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":245,"end":252},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":253,"end":257},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":334,"end":341},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":342,"end":346},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":466,"end":471},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
