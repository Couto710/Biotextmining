A region including exon1 in the IRF-4 promoter exhibited a large number of CpG-rich sequences (Figure 3A). Several chemical substances such as 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (AzadC) or 5-azacytidine (AzaC) inhibit de novo and maintenance methylation, and thus can be used to discern promoter methylation (32,33). We used AzadC to generate unmethylated DNA. A 72 h AzadC-treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent activation of IRF-4 transcription in Jurkat and CML-T1 T-cells as well as in U-937, K-562 and EM-2 cell lines (Figure 2A). IRF-4 transcription was induced in a time-dependent manner and was observed as early as 24 h after treatment with AzadC and increased over time until 72 h (Figure 2B). Time and strength of the appearance of IRF-4 transcripts varied among cell lines, i.e. CML-T1 responded strongest to AzadC-treatment (data not shown). In line with this, AzadC-treatment of CML-T1 and LAMA-84 cells also translated in an induction of IRF-4 protein expression (Figure 2C). Accordingly, treatment of the IRF-4-positive cell line BV-173, SD-1 and RPMI-8226 with AzadC had no effect on IRF-4 expression (Figure 2D). There was no difference in the effects of AzaC versus AzadC, as both increased the IRF-4 mRNA level in CML-T1 cells as well (data not shown). This implied that promoter methylation may control IRF-4 expression, but an alternative explanation may be activation of positive transcriptional regulators of IRF-4 by AzadC (or AzaC).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":0,"end":8},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":12,"end":17},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":18,"end":28},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":172,"end":177},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":178,"end":188},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":222,"end":227},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":599,"end":609},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":613,"end":618},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":619,"end":632},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":722,"end":727},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":728,"end":741},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":746,"end":753},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":846,"end":855},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":929,"end":934},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":935,"end":946},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1139,"end":1144},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":1207,"end":1212},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":1213,"end":1221},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":1277,"end":1283},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":1287,"end":1292},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":1293,"end":1303},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":1386,"end":1395},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":1400,"end":1405},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":1406,"end":1416},"obj":"Transcription"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1502,"end":1509},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":1510,"end":1515},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1516,"end":1526},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":1619,"end":1624},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E14","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E16","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E5","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E6","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E9"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Negation","obj":"E11"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E15"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
