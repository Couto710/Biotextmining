Antigen expression was then analyzed by flow cytometry. A: Histograms of ICAM-1 expression in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). B: Fluorescence intensity for expression of the antigens HLA-ABC, HLA-DR, CD14, ICAM-1, and CD58 in cells treated with medium only (control), 10 kDa dCGN (C10), or 40 kDa dCGN (C40). Data are mean +/\u2212 SEM.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":13,"end":23},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":24,"end":30},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":31,"end":41},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":299,"end":305},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":306,"end":316},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":433,"end":443},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":433,"end":443},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":433,"end":443},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":477,"end":481},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":483,"end":489},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":495,"end":499},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R5","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R7","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
