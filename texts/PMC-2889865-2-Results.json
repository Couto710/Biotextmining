However, the signal transduction pathways and subsequent inflammatory cytokine induction by these transcription factors is not fully elucidated. The present study is aimed at determining the involvement of AP-1 and NF-\u03baB in cytokine induction and regulation. PMA treatment resulted in an up-regulation of AP-1 after 2 h exposure and continued to increase throughout the analysis period (figure 1a). HK E. coli treatment did not affect AP-1 activation in Jurkat T-cells (figure 1b). To determine the involvement of associated pathways, we exposed cells to Ca2+ ionophore with or without PMA and observed a modest involvement of Ca2+ in PMA-dependent AP-1 activation (figure 1c) while Ca2+ alone did not alter AP-1 activity (data not shown). Furthermore, AP-1 activity decreased in a TCR-deficient Jurkat cell line when exposed to PMA compared to the parent cell line indicating that regulation of AP-1 was only partially T-cell receptor dependent (figure 1d).\nNF-\u03baB levels showed a transient increase at 1 min after exposure to PMA (figure 2a). However, 1 h after exposure the NF-\u03baB levels began to drop reaching the lowest levels by 6 h, after which they increased again by 24 h. Exposure of Jurkat T-cells to HK E. coli resulted in a dose-dependent NF-\u03baB activation, with the highest activity observed at a relative concentration of 5 \u00d7 107 CFU/ml (figure 2b). The time-dependent activation of NF-\u03baB by HK E. coli was assessed further using the optimal concentration obtained from figure 2b and showed that the NF-\u03baB activity increased after 3 h of exposure (figure 2c). Furthermore, increased intracellular Ca2+ reversed the PMA dependent NF-\u03baB inhibition (figure 2d) and reduced the HK E. coli -dependent NF-\u03baB activation (figure 2e).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
