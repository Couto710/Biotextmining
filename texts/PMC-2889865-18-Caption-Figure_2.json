Transfection of Jurkat T-cells was performed using luciferase reporter plasmids containing NF-\u03baB cis-elements. (A) Time-dependent stimulation of Jurkat T-cells using PMA. NF-\u03baB activation was evaluated using HK E. coli in a (B) dose- and (C) time-dependant manner. Calcium ionophore increased NF-\u03baB activity following PMA exposure (E) and resulted in a negative regulation in response to HK E. coli stimulation (D). Statistical significance from the control was determined using Student's t-test. (n = 4). Controls were arbitrarily set to 1.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":161,"end":171},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
