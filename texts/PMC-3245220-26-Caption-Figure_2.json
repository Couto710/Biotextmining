(B) RAW 264.7 cells transfected with the pNF-\u03baB-SEAP construct were pre-incubated with inhibitors for 30 minutes prior to 2 hours of stimulation with mouse recombinant M-CSF. The NF-\u03baB activity was analyzed by measuring SEAP production in the medium and data are expressed as fold increase of SEAP activity over that in pTAL-SEAP transfected resting cells. The graph represents mean \u00b1 S.E.M for three independent experiments. *The p-values of cells treated with inhibitors/M-CSF compared to vehicle/M-CSF were \u22640.05.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":44,"end":49},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":219,"end":224},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":406,"end":411},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":711,"end":716},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":737,"end":742},"obj":"Protein"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
