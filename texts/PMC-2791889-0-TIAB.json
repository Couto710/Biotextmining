However, the signals that direct the development of IL-10-producing T helper 1 (Th1) cells are undefined. We showed that development of IL-10-producing Th1 cells required high T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR) ligation, sustained ERK1 and ERK2 MAP kinases phosphorylation, and IL-12-induced STAT4 transcription factor activation. Repeated TCR triggering led to enhanced IL-10 production by Th1 cells, and continued IL-12 action and high-dose TCR signaling were required for the development and maintenance of IL-10-producing Th1 cells. Although Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells require the activation of distinct STATs for their differentiation, activation of ERK1 and ERK2 was\u00a0a common requirement for production of IL-10 by all Th cell subsets. IL-10 expression also correlated with c-maf expression. Despite having distinct functions in protection against pathogens, all Th cells share the important task of controlling overexuberant immune responses by means of IL-10 production.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":14},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":15,"end":25},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":39,"end":47},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":39,"end":47},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":48,"end":62},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":63,"end":70},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":71,"end":76},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":102,"end":105},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":117,"end":127},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":157,"end":160},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":170,"end":179},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":170,"end":179},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":180,"end":194},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":196,"end":201},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":207,"end":219},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":221,"end":226},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":316,"end":321},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":322,"end":331},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":400,"end":405},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":406,"end":415},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":482,"end":486},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":491,"end":495},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":508,"end":523},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":508,"end":523},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":529,"end":534},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":535,"end":542},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":543,"end":548},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":570,"end":580},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":613,"end":621},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":622,"end":627},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":628,"end":638},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":667,"end":672},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":713,"end":721},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":761,"end":766},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":767,"end":776},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":890,"end":900},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":890,"end":900},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":904,"end":908},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":913,"end":917},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":931,"end":942},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":931,"end":942},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":947,"end":957},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":961,"end":966},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":991,"end":996},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":997,"end":1007},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1029,"end":1034},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1035,"end":1045},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1210,"end":1215},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1216,"end":1226},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T7","obj":"T6"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R11","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R14","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R16","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R18","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R2","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T9","obj":"T8"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E15","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R22","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E17","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E21","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R27","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E18","obj":"E20"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"E21"},{"id":"R29","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E21","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R30","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E19","obj":"E22"},{"id":"R31","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T22","obj":"E23"},{"id":"R32","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T23","obj":"E24"},{"id":"R33","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T24","obj":"E25"},{"id":"R4","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R5","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E3","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R6","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R7","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E1","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R9","pred
