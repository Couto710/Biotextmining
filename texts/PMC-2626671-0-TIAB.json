CTLs lyse infected or aberrant target cells by exocytosis of lytic granules containing the pore-forming protein perforin and a family of proteases termed granzymes. We show that effector CTL differentiation occurs in two sequential phases in vitro, characterized by early induction of T-bet and late induction of Eomesodermin (Eomes), T-box transcription factors that regulate the early and late phases of interferon (IFN) \u03b3 expression, respectively. In addition, we demonstrate a critical role for the transcription factor Runx3 in CTL differentiation. Runx3 regulates Eomes expression as well as expression of three cardinal markers of the effector CTL program: IFN-\u03b3, perforin, and granzyme B. Our data point to the existence of an elaborate transcriptional network in which Runx3 initially induces and then cooperates with T-box transcription factors to regulate gene transcription in differentiating CTLs.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":113,"end":116},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":327,"end":335},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":487,"end":496},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":500,"end":505},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":515,"end":524},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":528,"end":540},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":542,"end":547},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":583,"end":591},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":583,"end":591},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":621,"end":639},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":640,"end":650},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":739,"end":744},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":769,"end":774},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":775,"end":784},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":775,"end":784},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":775,"end":784},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":775,"end":784},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":785,"end":790},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":791,"end":801},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":813,"end":823},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":813,"end":823},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":813,"end":823},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":879,"end":884},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":886,"end":894},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":900,"end":910},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":993,"end":998},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E3"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T7","obj":"E4"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E4","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R14","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E5"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E7","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E6"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R18","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R19","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R20","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E11","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R22","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R24","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R25","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R26","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R7","pred":"equivalentTo","subj":"T6","obj":"T5"},{"id":"R8","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R9","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
