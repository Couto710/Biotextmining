Cells (1.5 \u00d7 106) were fixed by sequential formaldehyde/methanol fixation as follows. Cells were carefully resuspended in FACS buffer and fixed with 100 \u03bcl of reagent A (Fix \u0026 Perm kit; Caltag Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States) at room temperature for 3 min followed by 2 ml of 70% methanol for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Cells were washed twice and permeabilized with 100 \u03bcl of reagent B (Fix \u0026 Perm kit) and stained for intracellular Foxp3 with mouse anti-human Foxp3 monoclonal antibody (0.5 \u03bcg of ab22510; Abcam) or the appropriate isotype control for 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained with Cy5-conjugated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin F(ab\u2032)2 secondary antibody (Caltag Laboratories) for an additional 30 min. Cells were washed twice and stained for surface CD4 expression with PE-labeled anti-CD4 (BD) and CD25 expression with FITC-labeled anti-CD25 (BD). Cells were washed twice and analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD). Data analysis was performed using FlowJo (Tree Star, Ashland, Oregon, United States).","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":28,"end":33},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":42,"end":52},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":630,"end":635},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":658,"end":663},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":968,"end":971},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":972,"end":982},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":1004,"end":1007},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":1017,"end":1021},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":1022,"end":1032},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":1056,"end":1060},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T4","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E3"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"},{"id":"M3","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E3"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
