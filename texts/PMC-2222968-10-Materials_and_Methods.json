The purity of CD4+ T cells was initially tested by FACS and was \u2265 95%. Monoclonality of T cell clones was confirmed by TCR-chain mapping and was identified to be Vbeta8 positive. The clones were characterized by high IL-4 secretion.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":13,"end":16},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":27,"end":30},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":108,"end":111},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":197,"end":200},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":395,"end":399},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":400,"end":404},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":405,"end":414},"obj":"Gene_expression"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T5","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
