In this regard, the inhibitors of DNA binding proteins (Ids) are considered to be some of the major target genes for Smad-signalling [17]. Thus, B cells were pre-incubated over night in X-VIVO 15, and then cultured in medium alone or in the presence of BMP-6 for various time points before preparation of total RNA. The amount of Id1\u2013Id4 mRNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Interestingly, we observed a specific four-fold upregulation of Id1 mRNA in BMP-6-treated B cells (Figure 7). The up-regulation of Id1 mRNA was characteristic of an early inducible gene, with maximal upregulation two hours after the addition of BMP-6 and returned to baseline after 24 hours. In contrast, no significant changes were observed for Id2 and Id3 mRNA, whereas Id4-transcripts were not detectable (Figure 7, data not shown).\nWestern blot analysis revealed that the BMP-6-induced upregulation of Id1 mRNA also was correlated with upregulation of Id1 protein as well. The increase in Id1 protein level was detectable after one hour and increased until 24 hours after BMP-6 addition, showing a 16-fold upregulation compared with t0 (p \u2264 0.020, n = 4) (Figure 8 and 9). In line with the mRNA data, no consistent change in the amounts of Id2 and Id3 protein could be observed (Figure 8 and 9). We were able to block the Id1 specific band with a blocking peptide (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that Id1 could be a possible target gene for mediating the effects of BMP-6 in human B cells, whereas Id2 and Id3 not seem to be involved.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":5},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":6,"end":13},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":14,"end":26},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":30,"end":33},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":73,"end":78},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E3","span":{"begin":79,"end":86},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E7","span":{"begin":79,"end":86},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E5","span":{"begin":79,"end":86},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E6","span":{"begin":87,"end":102},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E4","span":{"begin":87,"end":102},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"E8","span":{"begin":87,"end":102},"obj":"Phosphorylation"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":106,"end":112},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":113,"end":114},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":115,"end":116},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":429,"end":434},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":506,"end":509},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":510,"end":513},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E9","span":{"begin":603,"end":615},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":619,"end":622},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":631,"end":636},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E10","span":{"begin":669,"end":682},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":686,"end":689},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E11","span":{"begin":755,"end":767},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":800,"end":805},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E12","span":{"begin":875,"end":882},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E13","span":{"begin":875,"end":882},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":901,"end":904},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":909,"end":912},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":927,"end":930},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E14","span":{"begin":952,"end":962},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T17","span":{"begin":1031,"end":1036},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E15","span":{"begin":1037,"end":1044},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E16","span":{"begin":1045,"end":1057},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T18","span":{"begin":1061,"end":1064},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E17","span":{"begin":1079,"end":1089},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E18","span":{"begin":1095,"end":1107},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T19","span":{"begin":1111,"end":1114},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E19","span":{"begin":1136,"end":1144},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T20","span":{"begin":1148,"end":1151},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E20","span":{"begin":1200,"end":1209},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"T21","span":{"begin":1231,"end":1236},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E21","span":{"begin":1265,"end":1277},"obj":"Positive_regulation"},{"id":"E22","span":{"begin":1374,"end":1380},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E24","span":{"begin":1374,"end":1380},"obj":"Regulation"},{"id":"E25","span":{"begin":1388,"end":1395},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E23","span":{"begin":1388,"end":1395},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T22","span":{"begin":1399,"end":1402},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T23","span":{"begin":1407,"end":1410},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E26","span":{"begin":1471,"end":1476},"obj":"Negative_regulation"},{"id":"T24","span":{"begin":1481,"end":1484},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T25","span":{"begin":1581,"end":1584},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T26","span":{"begin":1646,"end":1651},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T27","span":{"begin":1678,"end":1681},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T28","span":{"begin":1686,"end":1689},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E2","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R10","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E8","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R11","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T3","obj":"E7"},{"id":"R12","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T6","obj":"E8"},{"id":"R13","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R14","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T11","obj":"E9"},{"id":"R15","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R16","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E10"},{"id":"R17","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T12","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R18","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E11"},{"id":"R19","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T14","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R2","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T1","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R20","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E12"},{"id":"R21","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T15","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R22","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E13"},{"id":"R23","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T16","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R24","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T13","obj":"E14"},{"id":"R25","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E16","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R26","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T17","obj":"E15"},{"id":"R27","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T18","obj":"E16"},{"id":"R28","pred":"themeOf","subj":"E18","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R29","pred":"causeOf","subj":"E16","obj":"E17"},{"id":"R3","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T2","obj":"E2"},{"id":"R30","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T19","obj":"E18"},{"id":"R31","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T20","obj":"E19"},{"id":"R32","pred":"causeOf","subj":"T21","obj":"E19"},{"i
