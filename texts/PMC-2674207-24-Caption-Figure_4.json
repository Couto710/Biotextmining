(D) Activated GR blocks the ability of purified phospho-GATA-3 isolated from anti-CD3/CD28\u2013stimulated cells interacting with immobilised importin-\u03b1 in an in vitro binding assay. *p\u003C0.05 compared to GATA-3 isolated from unstimulated cells. #p\u003C0.05 compared to stimulated GATA-3-importin binding.
