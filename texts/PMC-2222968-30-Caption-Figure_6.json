After 5 d, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (A) and results of six independent experiments are shown in the bar graph below (B). Statistical significance (one-way Anova, Newman-Keuls) is indicated by asterisks (**p \u2264 0.01, ***p \u2264 0.001). (C) Kinetic analysis of intracellular GATA3 and FOXP3 staining is shown in panel C following exposure of CD4+CD45RA+ T cells to anti-CD3/28, IL-4 and TGF-\u03b2. Data are representative of three independent experiments.","project":"bionlp-st-ge-2016-reference","denotations":[{"id":"T1","span":{"begin":0,"end":4},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T2","span":{"begin":14,"end":19},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T3","span":{"begin":59,"end":62},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T4","span":{"begin":63,"end":69},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T5","span":{"begin":114,"end":117},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T6","span":{"begin":118,"end":122},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T7","span":{"begin":124,"end":129},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T8","span":{"begin":135,"end":139},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T9","span":{"begin":436,"end":441},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T10","span":{"begin":446,"end":451},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"E1","span":{"begin":452,"end":460},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"E2","span":{"begin":452,"end":460},"obj":"Gene_expression"},{"id":"T11","span":{"begin":503,"end":506},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T12","span":{"begin":507,"end":513},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T13","span":{"begin":531,"end":534},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T14","span":{"begin":535,"end":537},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T15","span":{"begin":539,"end":543},"obj":"Protein"},{"id":"T16","span":{"begin":548,"end":553},"obj":"Protein"}],"relations":[{"id":"R1","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T9","obj":"E1"},{"id":"R2","pred":"themeOf","subj":"T10","obj":"E2"}],"modifications":[{"id":"M1","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E1"},{"id":"M2","pred":"Speculation","obj":"E2"}],"namespaces":[{"prefix":"_base","uri":"http://bionlp.dbcls.jp/ontology/ge.owl#"}]}
