Synthesis of Phenol and Quinone Metabolites of Benzo[ a ]pyrene, a Carcinogenic Component of Tobacco Smoke Implicated in Lung Cancer Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread environmental pollutants produced in the combustion of organic matter. PAHs are present in automobile exhaust and tobacco smoke, and they have recently been designated as human carcinogens. Current evidence indicates that PAHs are activated enzymatically to mutagenic metabolites that interact with DNA. There is evidence for three pathways of activation, the diol epoxide path, the radical-cation path, and the quinone path. The relative importance of these paths for human lung cancer has not been established. We now report syntheses of the principal phenol and quinone isomers of the prototype PAH carcinogen benzo[ a ]pyrene (BP) that are known or are suspected to be formed as metabolites of BP in human bronchoalveolar cells. The methods of synthesis were designed to be adaptable to preparation of the 13 C -labelled analogues of the BP metabolites. These compounds are needed as standards for sensitive LC-MS/MS methods for analysis of BP metabolites formed in lung cells. Efficient novel syntheses of the 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-BP phenols, and the BP 1,6-, 3,6-, 6,12-, and 9,10-quinones are now reported. The syntheses of the BP phenols (except 6-HO-BP) involve in the key steps Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of a naphthalene boronate ester with a substituted aryl bromide or triflate ester. The BP quinones were synthesized from the corresponding BP phenols by direct oxidation with the hypervalent iodine reagents IBX or TBI. These reagents exhibited different regiospecificities. IBX oxidation of the 7- and 9- BP phenols provided the ortho -quinone isomers (BP 7,8-, and 9.10-dione), whereas TBI oxidation of the 1-, 3-, and 12-BP phenols furnished BP quinone isomers with carbonyl functions in separate rings (BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-dione).  Introduction Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are widespread environmental pollutants that are produced in the combustion of organic matter. 1 - 3 PAHs are components of automobile and diesel engine exhaust 4 and tobacco smoke, 5 - 7 and they are implicated as causative agents for lung cancer, 2 , 5 - 10 the principal category of adult cancer death in the U.S. population. 11 For PAHs to exert their carcinogenic effects, metabolic activation is required. 3 Benzo-[ a ]pyrene (BP) is the prototype PAH carcinogen that has been most intensively investigated. Three activation pathways have been proposed. The most studied path involves cytochrome P-450 [CYP]-mediated formation of BP trans -7,8-dihydrodiol ( BP 7,8-diol) and its oxidation to the highly mutagenic BP trans -7,8-diol- anti -9,10-epoxide ( anti - BPDE ). 3 , 12 A second path entails aldo-keto reductase [AKR]-mediated oxidation of BP 7,8-diol to BP 7,8-catechol that enters into a redox cycle with O2 to form a quinone (BP 7,8-dione) along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) that attack DNA. 13 - 16 The third path entails peroxidase-mediated oxidation of BP to form a radical-cation that reacts with DNA, leading to formation of depurinated adducts. 17 , 18 The relative importance of these activation routes for human cancer has not been established. Numerous studies of the metabolism of BP by rodent liver microsomes and other model cell systems have been conducted. 3 , 19 , 20 However, most of these investigation were carried out without an appreciation of all the participating pathways or sufficiently sensitive analytical methods or standards to adequately characterize all the metabolites formed. More recently, human bronchoalveolar H358 cells were introduced as a model to study the metabolic profile of BP in normal human lung epithelial cells. 21 , 22 Development of a stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometric analytical method to quantify the adducts formed with DNA by the metabolites of BP was also reported. 23 Enhancement of the scope and sensitivity of the LC-MS analytical methodology requires 13 C -labelled analogues of BP and its metabolites as authentic standards. In this connection, we recently reported syntheses of 13 C 2-BP, 13 C 2-BP 7,8-diol, 13 C 2-BP 7,8-dione, and 13 C 2-8-HO-BP. 24 We now report improved new syntheses of the principal phenol and quinone isomers of BP formed in its metabolism in human bronchoalveolar H358 cells. 21 The synthetic approaches were designed to be adaptable to syntheses of the corresponding 13 C -labelled analogues of these BP metabolites with two or more 13 C -atoms in the PAH ring system.  Results The phenol and quinone isomers of BP chosen as synthetic targets for this investigation include the 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-phenol isomers (1-HO-BP, 3-HO-BP, 6-HO-BP, 9-HO-BP, and 12-HO-BP) and the 1,6-, 3,6-, 6,12-, and 9,10-quinone isomers (BP 1,6-dione, BP 3,6-dione, BP 6,12-dione, and BP 9,10-dione). Although not all of these isomers have been identified as metabolites of BP in H358 cells, 21 the evidence suggests that some phenol isomers may not have survived sufficiently long to be detected due to the facility of their oxidation to quinones or higher oxidized products. For example, 6-HO-BP was not found as a metabolite, yet BP 1,6-dione and BP 3,6-dione were identified as the principal BP quinone metabolites. 21 The fact that 6-HO-BP is a metabolic precursor of the BP 1,6-, 3,6- and 6,12-diones 20 suggests that 6-HO-BP is formed but fails to persist due to its further oxidation to the BP 1,6-, 3,6- and 6,12-diones. Other unidentified BP phenol or quinone isomers for which standards were not available may also have been formed but escaped detection because they happen to coelute on chromatography with an isomer for which a standard was available. Satisfactory resolution of these questions requires that the isomeric BP phenol and quinone metabolites that were not available for the initial metabolism studies should be synthesized to serve as additional analytical standards. Synthesis of all twelve BP phenol isomers by classical synthetic methods have been described in the literature. 25 , 26 However, these syntheses involve relatively large numbers of steps and they were not designed to serve as the basis of methods for efficient syntheses of the 13 C -labelled analogues of the BP phenol isomers. Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-3-ol (3-HO-BP) 3-HO-BP was the principal phenol isomer detected as a metabolite of BP in H358 cells. 21 Synthesis of 3-HO-BP was accomplished via the reaction sequence in Scheme 1 . The key step entailed Pd-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of the 2-boronate ester of 7-methoxy-naphthalene ( 3 ) with 2-bromophenylacetone ( 4 ). The boronate ester 3 was prepared from 7-methoxy-2-naphthol ( 1a ) via initial conversion to its triflate ester ( 1b ) by the procedure reported. 27 Reaction of 1b (1 mmol) with bis(neopentylglycolato)diboron ( 2 ) (1.2 mmol) in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 (0.03 mmol) as catalyst and KOAc as base took place in DMSO at 80 °C to afford the boronate ester 3 in moderate yield (40%). A brief study of this reaction was undertaken with the aim of improving the yield of 3 ( Table 1 ). It was not significantly enhanced by the use of Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst, increase in reaction time, or use of CH3CN as solvent. On the other hand, the yield of 3 was significantly improved and reaction time was decreased with the use of THF or dioxane as solvent. The optimum yield (82%) was obtained with dioxane as solvent. Cross-coupling of 3 with 4 took place in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and Na2CO3 in DME to furnish 2-(7-methoxynaphthyl)phenylacetone ( 5 ) as principal product (62%). It was recently shown 28 that acid-catalyzed cyclization of an analogue of 5 lacking a methoxy group was acccompanied by secondary rearrangement of the bay region methyl group of the product to the adjacent ring position due to steric crowding. Rearrangement was diminished by the use of TiCl4 as catalyst. TiCl4-catalyzed cyclization of 5 furnished 3-methoxy-5-methylchrysene ( 6 ) as major product (74%). Conversion of the methyl group of 6 to an aldehyde function was accomplished via bromination with NBS to give 5-bromomethyl-3-methoxychrysene ( 7a ), and reaction of 7a with DMSO and NaHCO3 yielded 5-formyl-3-methoxychrysene ( 7b ). Although 7a was unstable, satisfactory yields of 7b could be obtained by the direct use of 7a without isolation. Wittig reaction of 7b with methoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine furnished 3-methoxy-5-(2-methoxy-vinyl)chrysene ( 8 ) as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 8 gave 3-methoxybenzo[ a ]pyrene (76% from 7b ), and demethylation by treatment with BBr3 provided 3-HO-BP. Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-1-ol (1-HO-BP) Synthesis of 1-HO-BP was carried out by a procedure analogous to that for preparation of 3-HO-BP ( Scheme 2 ). The 2-boronate ester of 5-methoxynaphthalene ( 10 ) was prepared from 5-methoxy-2-naphthol ( 9a ) via conversion to the triflate ester ( 9b ) followed by reaction of 9b with 2 in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 by the procedure for preparation of 3 . Cross-coupling of 10 with 4 with Pd(PPh3)4 and Na2CO3 in DME gave 2-(5-methoxynaphthyl)phenylacetone ( 11 ) (77%). TiCl4-catalyzed cyclodehydration of 11 afforded 1-methoxy-5-methylchrysene ( 12 ) (68%), and reaction of 12 with NBS gave 13a which was converted to 5-formyl-1-methoxychrysene ( 13b ) (74%) by reaction with DMSO and NaHCO3. 28 , 30 Wittig reaction of 13b with methoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine yielded 1-methoxy-5-(2-methoxyvinyl)chrysene ( 14 ) (90%) as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 14 afforded 1-methoxybenzo[ a ]pyrene. Attempted demethylation by treatment with BBr3 was unsuccessful, but conversion of 1-MeO-BP to 1-HO-BP was accomplished by treatment with HI/HOAc. The usefulness of HI/HOAc for demethylation of aryl ethers was noted in an earlier study, 32 but the scope of the method was not explored. It appears that HI/HOAc may be a superior to BBr3 as a reagent for demethylation of PAH methyl ethers. Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-9-ol (9-HO-BP) Synthesis of 9-HO-BP was carried out by a procedure analogous to that reported for preparation of 7-benzo[ a ]pyren-7-ol ( Scheme 3 ). 31 , 32 2-Bromobenzene-1,3-dialdehyde ( 15 ) was synthesized by the reported method, 31 and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of 15 with the boronate ester ( 3 ) catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4 furnished the dialdehyde adduct ( 16 ). Double Wittig reaction of 16 with (methoxymethylene)triphenylphosphine (CH3OCH=PPh3) 24 provided the di(methoxyvinyl) derivative ( 17 ) as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 17 furnished 9-methoxybenzo[ ? ]pyrene, and demethylation with BBr3 gave 9-HO-BP. Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-12-ol (12-HO-BP) Synthesis of 12-HO-BP is outlined in Scheme 4 . The 2-boronate ester of 1-methyl-naphthalene ( 19 ) was prepared from 1-methyl-2-naphthol ( 18a ) via conversion to the triflate ester ( 18b ) followed by reaction of 18b with 6 in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2. Reaction of 19 with 2-bromobenzaldehyde in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and Na2CO3 in DME gave 2-(5-methyl-naphthalen-2-yl)phenylacetone ( 20 ) (74%), and reaction of 20 with methoxymethylenetriphenyl-phosphine furnished 21 as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 21 afforded 12-methylbenz[ a ]anthracene ( 22a ). This was converted to 12-HO-BP via bromination with NBS to yield 22b , reaction of 22b with KCN to provide 22c , hydrolysis of 22c with KOH in ethylene glycol to yield 22d , and acid-catalyzed cyclization of 22d to furnish 12-HO-BP. 26g Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-6-ol (6-HO-BP) The most convenient synthetic precursors of 6-HO-BP and 13C2-6-HO-BP are BP and 13C2-BP themselves. An efficient synthesis of 13C2-BP from was recently reported. 24 Direct synthesis of 6-HO-BP from BP was accomplished via initial Vilsmeier-Haack reaction of BP with POCl3 and DMF to furnish 8-formylbenzo[ a ]pyrene ( 23 ) ( Scheme 4 ). 33 Baeyer-Villager oxidation of 23 with m -chloroperbenzoic acid provides 8-formyloxybenzo[ a ]pyrene ( 24 ). The formate ester derivative was relatively stable in contrast to 6-HO-BP which exhibited a strong tendency to undergo oxidative decomposition on exposure to air. The ease of auto-oxidation of 6-HO-BP accords with the earlier findings of Lorentzen et al 20c who showed the principal products of auto-oxidation of 6-HO-BP to be the the BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-diones. Synthesis of BP Quinones Direct oxidation of BP with chromium reagents, ceric ammonium nitrate, and other oxidants has been shown by various investigators to furnish mixtures of BP quinones that are difficult to separate. 34 This problem was reinvestigated by Cho and Harvey 35 who used careful chromatographic techniques to isolate and identify the pure BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-dione isomers. They were obtained in yields of 40, 20, and 7 %, respectively. However, this approach is impractical for synthesis of the individual pure 13C-labelled BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-diones. A more promising synthetic route to the BP quinones of interest is via oxidation of the individual BP phenol isomers. In a prior study we showed that oxidation of 8-HO-BP with the hypervalent iodine reagent o -iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) provided convenient synthetic access to BP 7,8-dione. 24 , 32 We now report that oxidation of 9-HO-BP with IBX by a similar procedure furnished BP 9,10-dione in good yield (82%). Attempts to oxidize 1-HO-BP or 3-HO-BP by IBX were not successful, failing to provide either the unknown ortho -quinone isomers (BP 1,2- or 2,3-dione) or the BP 1,6- or 3,6-quinone isomers. Transformation of 1-HO-BP and 3-HO-BP to the desired BP quinone isomers (BP 1,6-dione and BP 3,6-dione) was accomplished by direct oxidation with another hypervalent iodine reagent, [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (BTI). BP 1,6-dione and BP 3,6-dione were obtained in yields of 82% and 85%, respectively. Similarly, oxidation of 12-HO-BP by BTI provided BP 6,12-dione. BTI was shown previously to oxidize substituted 1-naphthols to 1,4-naphtho-quinones, 37 but no examples of its use for oxidation of PAH phenols with larger ring systems have been reported. BTI holds promise as a reagent for regioselective oxidation of PAH phenols to quinones with carbonyl functions in separate rings, such as the BP 1,6- and 3,6-diones.  Results The phenol and quinone isomers of BP chosen as synthetic targets for this investigation include the 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-phenol isomers (1-HO-BP, 3-HO-BP, 6-HO-BP, 9-HO-BP, and 12-HO-BP) and the 1,6-, 3,6-, 6,12-, and 9,10-quinone isomers (BP 1,6-dione, BP 3,6-dione, BP 6,12-dione, and BP 9,10-dione).

The boronate ester 3 was prepared from 7-methoxy-2-naphthol ( 1a ) via initial conversion to its triflate ester ( 1b ) by the procedure reported. 27 Reaction of 1b (1 mmol) with bis(neopentylglycolato)diboron ( 2 ) (1.2 mmol) in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 (0.03 mmol) as catalyst and KOAc as base took place in DMSO at 80 °C to afford the boronate ester 3 in moderate yield (40%). A brief study of this reaction was undertaken with the aim of improving the yield of 3 ( Table 1 ). It was not significantly enhanced by the use of Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst, increase in reaction time, or use of CH3CN as solvent. On the other hand, the yield of 3 was significantly improved and reaction time was decreased with the use of THF or dioxane as solvent. The optimum yield (82%) was obtained with dioxane as solvent. Cross-coupling of 3 with 4 took place in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and Na2CO3 in DME to furnish 2-(7-methoxynaphthyl)phenylacetone ( 5 ) as principal product (62%). It was recently shown 28 that acid-catalyzed cyclization of an analogue of 5 lacking a methoxy group was acccompanied by secondary rearrangement of the bay region methyl group of the product to the adjacent ring position due to steric crowding. Rearrangement was diminished by the use of TiCl4 as catalyst. TiCl4-catalyzed cyclization of 5 furnished 3-methoxy-5-methylchrysene ( 6 ) as major product (74%). Conversion of the methyl group of 6 to an aldehyde function was accomplished via bromination with NBS to give 5-bromomethyl-3-methoxychrysene ( 7a ), and reaction of 7a with DMSO and NaHCO3 yielded 5-formyl-3-methoxychrysene ( 7b ). Although 7a was unstable, satisfactory yields of 7b could be obtained by the direct use of 7a without isolation. Wittig reaction of 7b with methoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine furnished 3-methoxy-5-(2-methoxy-vinyl)chrysene ( 8 ) as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 8 gave 3-methoxybenzo[ a ]pyrene (76% from 7b ), and demethylation by treatment with BBr3 provided 3-HO-BP.  Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-1-ol (1-HO-BP) Synthesis of 1-HO-BP was carried out by a procedure analogous to that for preparation of 3-HO-BP ( Scheme 2 ). The 2-boronate ester of 5-methoxynaphthalene ( 10 ) was prepared from 5-methoxy-2-naphthol ( 9a ) via conversion to the triflate ester ( 9b ) followed by reaction of 9b with 2 in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2 by the procedure for preparation of 3 . Cross-coupling of 10 with 4 with Pd(PPh3)4 and Na2CO3 in DME gave 2-(5-methoxynaphthyl)phenylacetone ( 11 ) (77%). TiCl4-catalyzed cyclodehydration of 11 afforded 1-methoxy-5-methylchrysene ( 12 ) (68%), and reaction of 12 with NBS gave 13a which was converted to 5-formyl-1-methoxychrysene ( 13b ) (74%) by reaction with DMSO and NaHCO3. 28 , 30 Wittig reaction of 13b with methoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine yielded 1-methoxy-5-(2-methoxyvinyl)chrysene ( 14 ) (90%) as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 14 afforded 1-methoxybenzo[ a ]pyrene. Attempted demethylation by treatment with BBr3 was unsuccessful, but conversion of 1-MeO-BP to 1-HO-BP was accomplished by treatment with HI/HOAc. The usefulness of HI/HOAc for demethylation of aryl ethers was noted in an earlier study, 32 but the scope of the method was not explored. It appears that HI/HOAc may be a superior to BBr3 as a reagent for demethylation of PAH methyl ethers.

Cross-coupling of 10 with 4 with Pd(PPh3)4 and Na2CO3 in DME gave 2-(5-methoxynaphthyl)phenylacetone ( 11 ) (77%). TiCl4-catalyzed cyclodehydration of 11 afforded 1-methoxy-5-methylchrysene ( 12 ) (68%), and reaction of 12 with NBS gave 13a which was converted to 5-formyl-1-methoxychrysene ( 13b ) (74%) by reaction with DMSO and NaHCO3. 28 , 30 Wittig reaction of 13b with methoxymethylenetriphenylphosphine yielded 1-methoxy-5-(2-methoxyvinyl)chrysene ( 14 ) (90%) as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 14 afforded 1-methoxybenzo[ a ]pyrene.

Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-9-ol (9-HO-BP) Synthesis of 9-HO-BP was carried out by a procedure analogous to that reported for preparation of 7-benzo[ a ]pyren-7-ol ( Scheme 3 ). 31 , 32 2-Bromobenzene-1,3-dialdehyde ( 15 ) was synthesized by the reported method, 31 and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling of 15 with the boronate ester ( 3 ) catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4 furnished the dialdehyde adduct ( 16 ). Double Wittig reaction of 16 with (methoxymethylene)triphenylphosphine (CH3OCH=PPh3) 24 provided the di(methoxyvinyl) derivative ( 17 ) as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 17 furnished 9-methoxybenzo[ ? ]pyrene, and demethylation with BBr3 gave 9-HO-BP.

Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-12-ol (12-HO-BP) Synthesis of 12-HO-BP is outlined in Scheme 4 . The 2-boronate ester of 1-methyl-naphthalene ( 19 ) was prepared from 1-methyl-2-naphthol ( 18a ) via conversion to the triflate ester ( 18b ) followed by reaction of 18b with 6 in the presence of Pd(dppf)Cl2. Reaction of 19 with 2-bromobenzaldehyde in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 and Na2CO3 in DME gave 2-(5-methyl-naphthalen-2-yl)phenylacetone ( 20 ) (74%), and reaction of 20 with methoxymethylenetriphenyl-phosphine furnished 21 as a mixture of E - and Z -isomers. Acid-catalyzed cyclization of 21 afforded 12-methylbenz[ a ]anthracene ( 22a ). This was converted to 12-HO-BP via bromination with NBS to yield 22b , reaction of 22b with KCN to provide 22c , hydrolysis of 22c with KOH in ethylene glycol to yield 22d , and acid-catalyzed cyclization of 22d to furnish 12-HO-BP. 26g  Benzo[<italic>a</italic>]pyren-12-ol (12-HO-BP) Synthesis of 12-HO-BP is outlined in Scheme 4 .

An efficient synthesis of 13C2-BP from was recently reported. 24 Direct synthesis of 6-HO-BP from BP was accomplished via initial Vilsmeier-Haack reaction of BP with POCl3 and DMF to furnish 8-formylbenzo[ a ]pyrene ( 23 ) ( Scheme 4 ). 33 Baeyer-Villager oxidation of 23 with m -chloroperbenzoic acid provides 8-formyloxybenzo[ a ]pyrene ( 24 ). The formate ester derivative was relatively stable in contrast to 6-HO-BP which exhibited a strong tendency to undergo oxidative decomposition on exposure to air. The ease of auto-oxidation of 6-HO-BP accords with the earlier findings of Lorentzen et al 20c who showed the principal products of auto-oxidation of 6-HO-BP to be the the BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-diones.

Synthesis of BP Quinones Direct oxidation of BP with chromium reagents, ceric ammonium nitrate, and other oxidants has been shown by various investigators to furnish mixtures of BP quinones that are difficult to separate. 34 This problem was reinvestigated by Cho and Harvey 35 who used careful chromatographic techniques to isolate and identify the pure BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-dione isomers. They were obtained in yields of 40, 20, and 7 %, respectively. However, this approach is impractical for synthesis of the individual pure 13C-labelled BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-diones. A more promising synthetic route to the BP quinones of interest is via oxidation of the individual BP phenol isomers. In a prior study we showed that oxidation of 8-HO-BP with the hypervalent iodine reagent o -iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX) provided convenient synthetic access to BP 7,8-dione. 24 , 32 We now report that oxidation of 9-HO-BP with IBX by a similar procedure furnished BP 9,10-dione in good yield (82%). Attempts to oxidize 1-HO-BP or 3-HO-BP by IBX were not successful, failing to provide either the unknown ortho -quinone isomers (BP 1,2- or 2,3-dione) or the BP 1,6- or 3,6-quinone isomers. Transformation of 1-HO-BP and 3-HO-BP to the desired BP quinone isomers (BP 1,6-dione and BP 3,6-dione) was accomplished by direct oxidation with another hypervalent iodine reagent, [bis(trifluoroacetoxy)iodo]benzene (BTI). BP 1,6-dione and BP 3,6-dione were obtained in yields of 82% and 85%, respectively. Similarly, oxidation of 12-HO-BP by BTI provided BP 6,12-dione. BTI was shown previously to oxidize substituted 1-naphthols to 1,4-naphtho-quinones, 37 but no examples of its use for oxidation of PAH phenols with larger ring systems have been reported. BTI holds promise as a reagent for regioselective oxidation of PAH phenols to quinones with carbonyl functions in separate rings, such as the BP 1,6- and 3,6-diones.

Discussion Oxidative metabolism of BP and other PAHs in mammalian cells is part of the normal process of enzymatic detoxification of xenobiotic substances. 3 , 16 , 19 Metabolism of BP by P-450 microsomal enzymes affords initially arene oxides that may either (i) rearrange to phenols or (ii) undergo epoxide hydrolase-catalyzed hydration to furnish trans -dihydrodiols, such as the BP trans -7,8- or trans -9,10-dihydrodiols. These primary metabolites are converted to glucuronides or other water-soluble conjugates that are eventually excreted. However, some of the primary metabolites are able to survive and undergo further oxidative metabolism to quinones, diol epoxides, and other potentially carcinogenic species. This paper reports efficient syntheses of the principal phenol and quinone isomers of BP that have been identified or are suspected to be formed as metabolites of BP in normal human bronchoalveolar cells. 21 The BP phenols include the 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-phenol isomers (1-HO-BP, 3-HO-BP, 6-HO-BP, 9-HO-BP, and 12-HO-BP). The BP quinone isomers are the BP 1,6-, 3,6-, 6,12-, and 9,10-diones. The syntheses of the BP phenols involve in the key steps Pd-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling of a naphthalene boronate ester derivative with an aryl bromide or a triflate ester. The BP quinones were synthesized from the BP phenols by oxidation with the hypervalent iodine reagents IBX and TBI. These reagents exhibited different regiospecificities of oxidation. Reaction of IBX with 7-HO- and 9-HO-BP yielded the ortho -quinone isomers (BP 7,8- and 9,10-dione), whereas reaction of TBI with 1-HO-, 3-HO-, and 12-HO-BP furnished exclusively quinone isomers with carbonyl functions in separate rings (BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-dione). The remarkable regioselectivities of these oxidations are consistent with the mechanisms. Oxidations with IBX are thought to proceed via initial reaction of the reagent with the phenol to form an intermediate complex. 38 This is followed by intramolecular transfer of an oxygen atom from the IBX component of the complex to the carbon atom adjacent to the hydroxyl group of the phenolic component, leading to formation of an ortho -quinone product. Oxidations with BTI also entail initial reaction of the reagent with the phenol to form an intermediate complex. 37 This reacts with water, generally at a less sterically restricted para position, thereby generating a para -catechol intermediate that undergoes further oxidation to yield a quinone product. The BP 1-, 3-, and 12-phenols lack a para position, so that the reactions of their intermediate complexes with water take place at the most reactive alternative site, the 6-position, to generate the BP 1,6-, 3,6-, and 6,12-diones. 39 These are the first examples of oxidation of PAH phenols with TBI to afford PAH quinones with carbonyl functions in separate rings. The synthetic approaches to the BP phenol and quinone metabolites outlined above were designed to be adaptable to preparation of 13 C -labelled analogues of these compounds. The isotopically-labelled compounds are needed as substrates and/or standards for metabolism and other studies in normal human lung cells. Syntheses of the 13 C -labelled analogues are in progress. This work is virtually complete and the findings will be reported shortly. The methods reported herein for synthesis of BP phenol derivatives via Suzuki cross-coupling are potentially broad in scope, providing convenient synthetic access to many other PAHs and their substituted derivatives.

The phenol and quinone isomers of BP have not been designated as carcinogenic hazards, but prudence suggests that they also be handled with caution. 2-(7-Methoxynaphthyl)phenylacetone (5) To a solution of 2-bromophenylacetone ( 4 ) (0.852 g, 4.0 mmol) in DME (10 mL) under argon was added Pd(PPh3)4 (46 mg, 0.40 mmol), and the resulting solution was stirred for 20 min. Then the boronic ester 3 (1.30 g, 4.8 mmol) and EtOH (15 mL) were added. Stirring was continued for 20 min, then NaCO3 (4 mL of a 2M solution) was added and the solution was heated at reflux for 4 h, then cooled to room temp.

Then the mixture was cooled to room temp., the precipitate of was filtered off and was washed with CCl4 (2 mL). To the solution were added DMSO (2.8 mL) and NaHCO3 (168 mg, 2 mmol), and the mixture was heated at 80-90 °C for 3.0 h (reaction was monitored by TLC).
