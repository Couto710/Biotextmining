Altered gene and protein expression by Nm23-H1 in metastasis suppression Metastasis suppressor genes (MSG) are characterized by their ability to inhibit the formation of metastasis, while not affecting the growth of the primary tumor in vivo. Nm23-H1, the first MSG to be characterized, has been shown to alter both gene and protein expression in cancer cells. Recently, microarray expression profiling revealed that Nm23-H1 downregulated EDG2 , which encodes for a lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor. Reintroduction of EDG2 into cells that express Nm23-H1 overcame the metastasis suppressive ability of Nm23-H1 in both in vivo pulmonary colonization and spontaneous metastasis assays. In addition, isotope capture affinity tag (ICAT) proteomic analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins not accounted for by micro-array analysis. ICAT identified several differentially regulated proteins, including GEMIN5, a protein involved in differential mRNA splicing. The contribution of alternative mRNA splicing to cancer and cancer metastasis is poorly defined. It is possible that Nm23-H1, through the regulation of RNA processing proteins, may play a role in proteome stability.
