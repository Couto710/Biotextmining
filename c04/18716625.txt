Neutralizing antibodies derived from the B cells of 1918 influenza pandemic survivors Investigation of the human antibody response to influenza virus infection has been largely limited to serology, with relatively little analysis at the molecular level. The 1918 H1N1 influenza virus pandemic was the most severe of the modern era 1 . Recent work has recovered the gene sequences of this unusual strain 2 , so that the 1918 pandemic virus could be reconstituted to display its unique virulence phenotypes 3 , 4 . However, little is known about adaptive immunity to this virus. We took advantage of the 1918 virus sequencing and the resultant production of recombinant 1918 hemagglutinin (HA) protein antigen to characterize at the clonal level neutralizing antibodies induced by natural exposure of survivors to the 1918 pandemic virus. In our study, each of 32 individuals tested that were born in or before 1915 exhibited seroreactivity with 1918 virus, nearly 90 years after the pandemic. Seven of 8 donor samples tested had circulating B cells that secreted antibodies that bound 1918 HA. We isolated B cells from subjects and generated five monoclonal antibodies that exhibited potent neutralizing activity against 1918 virus from three separate donors. These antibodies also cross-reacted with the genetically similar HA of a 1930 swine H1N1 influenza strain, but not with HAs of more contemporary human influenza viruses. The antibody genes exhibited an unusually high degree of somatic mutation. The antibodies bound to the 1918 HA protein with high affinity, exhibited exceptional virus neutralizing potency, and protected mice from lethal infection. Isolation of viruses that escaped inhibition suggested that the antibodies recognize classical antigenic sites on the HA surface. Thus, these studies reveal that survivors of the 1918 influenza pandemic possess highly functional, virus-neutralizing antibodies to this uniquely virulent virus, and that humans can sustain circulating B memory cells to viruses for many decades after exposure - well into the tenth decade of life.  Methods Subjects Volunteers born in 1915 or earlier were recruited at the UMDNJ site. We obtained from each subject 50 mL of peripheral venous blood following written informed consent. Antigen Recombinant A/South Carolina/1/1918 virus HA was generated in a baculovirus expression system and purified, as described 11 . Production of mAbs PBMCs were obtained from eight donors by density gradient centrifugation of whole heparinized blood. B cells were transformed in 384-well plates with approximately 1000 B cells per well by in vitro culture in medium with CpG ODN 10103 (Coley) and EBV (supernate from cell line B95.8). Supernates from the resulting cell lines were tested for reactivity with 1918 HA by ELISA. Hybridomas were generated using cells from wells containing reactive lines by fusion to the HMMA2.5 nonsecreting myeloma cell line 7 using electrofusion followed by HAT/ouabain drug selection, as described 8 . When hybridomas formed colonies, lines were screened using anti-1918 HA ELISA; positive lines were cloned by limiting dilution. Supernates of high-density cultures were produced in CELLine Devices (BD Biosciences). Purified and concentrated preparations of each of the antibodies were prepared by FPLC using protein G conjugated resin on an AKTA instrument (GE Healthcare) followed by concentration and buffer exchange using ultra centrifugal filter devices (Millipore). Characterization of mAbs The isotype and subclass of secreted mAbs were determined by ELISA. Nucleotide sequences of variable gene segments were determined from cloned cDNA generated by RT-PCR amplification of cellular mRNA using variable gene specific primers designed to amplify antibody genes from all gene families 22 . Identity of the gene segments and mutations from the germline sequences were determined by alignment using the ImMunoGeneTics database ( http://imgt.cines.fr:8104 ) 23 . Viruses and plasmids The following viruses were propagated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs: A/Weiss/43; A/FM/1/47; A/USSR/92/77; A/New Caledonia/20/99; A/swine/Iowa/15/30. The sequences of the HA genes of these viruses used were confirmed by RT-PCR and cDNA sequence analysis. Influenza A/South Carolina/1/18 virus was prepared as described 3 . Expression plasmids encoding the 1918 HA and NA proteins were described previously 24 , 25 . ELISA Equivalent HA units of 1918 virus-like particles (VLPs) or of influenza A viruses were diluted in coating buffer (51-2713KC; BD) and adsorbed overnight onto ELISA plates (Nunc). Plates were washed with PBS/0.05% Tween-20 and blocked using blocking solution (555213; BD) or PBS containing 5% FCS at RT for 1 hour. Diluted mAbs were added to plates and incubated at 4 °C for 16 hours. Plates were washed and incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (H10507; Caltag) for 1 hour. Washed plates were developed using TMB substrate, and the reaction was stopped using 2N sulfuric acid. Optical density was read at 450 nm using an ELISA plate reader. Production of VLPs VLPs were produced by co-transfection of 10 6 293T cells with 1 ?g each of expression plasmids for the 1918 HA and NA. Two days post-transfection, supernatants were harvested and assayed for HA activity. Our ability to produce these hemagglutinating particles in the absence of other viral proteins is consistent with a recent report 26 . HAI assays of sera or mAbs were performed according to standard protocols 27 . Briefly, sera were diluted initially 1:10 in receptor-destroying enzyme from Vibrio cholerae (Denka Seiken, Tokyo). Serial dilutions of sera or mAbs were pre-incubated with 8 HA units of virus per well. Chicken RBCs were added to a final concentration of 0.5%, and the plate was incubated on ice for 30-60 minutes. Microneutralization assay 10 TCID50 units of virus was preincubated with dilutions of sera or mAb and used to infect MDCK cells in 96-well plates with six replicates, as described 28 . Neutralizing concentrations were defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum where 50% of wells were infected, as calculated by the method of Reed and Muench 29 . Specific neutralizing activity of mAbs was calculated as the lowest concentration of mAb that displayed activity. Biosensor studies The kinetic interaction of mAbs with recombinant 1918 HA protein was determined by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 2000 instrument (Biacore, Piscataway, NJ). Purified 1918 HA protein was diluted to 30 ?g/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.5, and covalently immobilized at 5 ?l/min by amine coupling to the dextran matrix of a CM5 sensor chip (Biacore AB) with a target density of 1,200 response units (RU). Unreacted active ester groups were blocked with 1 M ethanolamine. All five purified 1918 mAbs and a human H5-specific influenza mAb (negative control) at different concentrations ranging from 5 to 500 nM in HBS/Tween-20 buffer (Biacore AB) were injected over the immobilized 1918 HA protein or reference cell surface. Association rates ( K on ), dissociation rates ( K off ), and equilibrium dissociation constants ( K D ) were calculated by aligning the binding curves globally to fit a 2:1 Langmuir binding model using BIAevaluation 4.1 software. The goodness of each fit was based on the agreement between experimental data and the calculated fits, where the X 2 values were below 1.0. Selection and characterization of antibody escape mutants Mutants were isolated as described 12 , 30 . Briefly, escape mutant viruses were selected by treatment of Sw/30 virus with excess antibody, followed by recovery of neutralization resistant viruses in eggs. RNA was extracted from virus-infected allantoic fluid, then cDNA was generated by RT-PCR, cloned, sequenced, and aligned to previously determined wt virus HA gene sequences. Animal studies Female BALB/c (8-week old) mice were inoculated intranasally with 5 LD50 in a 50 ?l volume of the virulent reconstituted 1918 virus. At 24 hrs after inoculation, we administered 200, 20, 2 or 0.2 ?g (approximately 10, 1, 0.1 or 0.01 mg/kg) of 1918-specific mAb or a similarly prepared human mAb to H5 influenza HA (clone IE5), or an equal volume of human IgG, to each mouse, in groups of 11 (highest dose) or 5 (lower doses) mice. Mice were observed for 16 days for weight loss or death. Subsets of 3 animals treated with the highest dose were sacrificed on day 2 and 4 after infection and whole lungs were homogenized in 1 mL of sterile PBS. Virus titer in lung tissue homogenates was determined by plaque titration in MDCK cell monolayer cultures.  Subjects Volunteers born in 1915 or earlier were recruited at the UMDNJ site.
