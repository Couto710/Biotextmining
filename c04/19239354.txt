Delaying a Treatment Switch in Antiretroviral-Treated HIV Type 1-Infected Patients with Detectable Drug-Resistant Viremia Does Not Have a Profound Effect on Immune Parameters: AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study A5115 Some patients are unable to achieve and maintain an undetectable plasma HIV-1 RNA level with combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and are therefore maintained on a partially suppressive regimen. To determine the immune consequences of continuing ART despite persistent viremia, we randomized 47 ART-treated individuals with low to moderate plasma HIV-1 RNA levels (200–9999 copies/ml) to either an immediate switch in therapy or a delayed switch (when plasma HIV-1 RNA became ?10,000 copies/ml). After 48 weeks of follow-up, naive and memory CD4+ T cell percents were comparable in the two groups. The proportion of subjects with a lymphocyte proliferative response to Candida , Mycobacterium avium- intracellulare complex, or HIV-gag was also not significantly different at week 48. Delaying a treatment switch in patients with partial virologic suppression and stable CD4+ T cells does not have profound effects on immune parameters.
