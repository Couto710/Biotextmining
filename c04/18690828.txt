Natural Products as Aromatase Inhibitors With the clinical success of several synthetic aromatase inhibitors (AIs) in the treatment of postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, researchers have also been investigating also the potential of natural products as AIs. Natural products from terrestrial and marine organisms provide a chemically diverse array of compounds not always available through current synthetic chemistry techniques. Natural products that have been used traditionally for nutritional or medicinal purposes (e.g., botanical dietary supplements) may also afford AIs with reduced side effects. A thorough review of the literature regarding natural product extracts and secondary metabolites of plant, microbial, and marine origin that have been shown to exhibit aromatase inhibitory activity is presented herein.  CONCLUSIONS Numerous natural product extracts, from plant, fungal, and microbial terrestrial and marine sources, have been evaluated for aromatase inhibition using various noncellular, cell-based, and in vivo assays. Some of the more active extracts included those of Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Imbach (white button mushrooms) [ 115 ] and Vitis L. sp. (grape and/or wine) [ 86 , 106 , 107 ], among others. Some aromatase activity-guided fractionation has been performed on Vitis sp. extracts, resulting in the isolation of various procyanidin dimers that have yet to be fully characterized [ 86 ]. Interestingly, several types of extracts and partitions of A. bisporus and a sample of Vitis sp. (grape) were subsequently tested for their ability to inhibit aromatase in microsomes and found to be inactive [ 143 ]. Several factors could be involved in the discrepancies between the literature results, including variations in the species collected, timing of collections, purity of materials extracted, preparation of extracts, and assay methodology. Several other extracts were determined to inhibit aromatase in microsomes including from Brassaiopsis glomerulata (Blume) Regel [ 108 ] and Garcinia mangostana L. (mangosteen) [ 109 ], with both of these species having undergone activity-guided purification resulting in the isolation of compounds with AI activity. Extracts of several cycads were also found to be potent AIs [ 104 ] but, to date, their bioassay-guided fractionation has not been performed. Another active extract that has not undergone fractionation is Euonymus alatus [ 111 ]. Active compounds isolated from these extracts may provide potent AIs and possible leads for further development. Nearly 300 natural product compounds have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit aromatase, in noncellular, cell-based, and in vivo aromatase inhibition assays. Flavonoids have been tested most frequently and generally found to be the most active class of natural product AI compounds. Some of the more active flavonoids included apigenin ( 8 ), chrysin ( 11 ), 7-hydroxyflavone ( 26 ), isolicoflavonol ( 27 ), (2 S )-abyssinone II ( 45 ), (2 S )-2',4'-dihydroxy-2”-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)dihydrofuro[2,3- h ]flavanone ( 49 ), eriodictyol ( 50 ), 8-prenylnaringenin ( 62 ), 3'-[?-hydroxymethyl-( E )-?-methylallyl]-2,4,2',4'-tetrahydroxychalcone 11'- O -coumarate ( 75 ), isoliquiritigenin ( 77 ), and rotenone ( 132 ). Other very active AI compounds included the xanthone, ?-mangostin ( 239 ), the sesquiterpene lactone, 11?H,13-dihydro-10- epi -8-deoxycumambrin ( 211 ), and the anthraquinone, benzanthraquinone I ( 249 ). Since natural product drug discovery efforts frequently utilize non-cellular screening assays, several of the compounds reported to be active in non-cellular assays should be avoided by future AI drug discovery endeavors. This is exemplified by the unsaturated fatty acids, which are commonly found in natural product extracts and have been shown to interfere with non-cellular AI assays [ 152 ]. Several flavonoids have also been found to be active in non-cellular screening and inactive in cell-based assays. In natural product AI screening efforts it is recommended that extracts active in non-cellular bioassays be dereplicated for the presence of known aromatase inhibitors prior to expensive and time-consuming bioassay-guided fractionation. All of the most active compounds were of the flavonoid or xanthone compound classes, with the exception of the active sesquiterpene lactone and the active anthraquinone. The ability of flavonoids to inhibit aromatase has been well established [ 169 , 170 ] and some flavonoids have continued into in vivo studies with various results [ 125 , 148 ]. Interestingly, Saarinen et al. [ 125 ] have shown that apigenin ( 8 ), chrysin ( 11 ), and naringenin ( 59 ) were all inactive using an in vivo AI mouse model. The AI activity of flavonoids needs further in vivo testing to substantiate the extensive and potent in vitro results. Various AI mouse models are currently available or in development, including a transgenic model that overexpresses aromatase [ 171 ], an aromatase-knockout mouse model [ 172 ], and a MCF-7 xenograft model [ 173 ]. Several natural product compounds have already undergone synthetic modifications to further enhance AI activity. Two separate syntheses have been performed on the strongly active flavone (2 S )-abyssinone II ( 45 ) [ 174 , 175 ] and several analogues have been found to be more active than the natural compound. Synthesis of 7,8-benzoflavanones has provided several leads with potent AI activity [ 176 ]. Ursolic acid ( 227 ) derivatives were synthesized with resulting compounds having lower activity than the natural product [ 177 ]. The diterpenoid, standishinal ( 203 ), and several synthetic derivatives were subjected to AI testing with the most active compounds having a cis -configuration on the A/B ring [ 178 ]. Synthetic xanthones have only recently been tested for their ability to inhibit aromatase [ 48 , 179 , 180 ] with extremely potent AI activity in the nanomolar range. However, very few natural product or synthetic compounds have undergone extensive evaluation using additional in vitro or in vivo and preclinical models. This review highlights several compound classes that may act as aromatase inhibitors (e.g., flavones, flavanones, chalcones, and xanthones) and other structural classes that are less active. These scaffolds may be utilized to direct synthetic modification of natural product scaffolds to enhance aromatase inhibition. New natural products or natural product analogues that inhibit aromatase may be clinically useful for treating postmenopausal breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors may also act as chemopreventive agents for preventing secondary recurrence of breast cancer. Furthermore, AIs from edible plant materials may eventually be appropriate for primary prevention of breast cancer in postmenopausal women (e.g., lower toxicity due to history of human consumption). Botanical dietary supplements or foods that are ingested regularly and act as AIs may have a role in breast cancer chemoprevention or chemotherapy for postmenopausal women.
