Imaging of Glioma Tumor with Endogneous Fluoresence Tomography Tomographic imaging of a glioma tumor with endogenous fluorescence is demonstrated using a non-contact single photon counting fan-beam acquisition system interfaced with microCT imaging. The fluorescence from protoporphyrin IX was found to be detectable, and allowed imaging of the tumor from within the cranium, even though the tumor presence was not visible in the microCT image. The combination of single photon counting detection and normalized fluorescence to transmission detection at each channel allowed robust imaging of the signal. This demonstrated use of endogenous fluorescence stimulation from aminolevulinic acid, provides the first in vivo demonstration of deep tissue tomographic imaging with protoporphyrin IX.
