Scalable Total Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Haouamine A and Its Atropisomer A total synthesis of the complex, bent aromatic ring-containing marine alkaloid haouamine A is achieved through a route in which every step (with the exception of the final deprotection) is performed on a gram-scale. This is accomplished through the development of a method for the dehydrogenation of cyclohexenones that allows for point-to-planar chirality transfer. This strategy makes it possible to program the desired atropisomeric outcome from a simple chiral cyclohexenone. By synthesizing atrop-haouamine A, this work has firmly established that natural haouamine exists as a single, non-equilibrating atropisomer. Finally, biological investigations demonstrate that the bent aromatic ring of this natural product is critical for anti-cancer activity against PC3 cells.
